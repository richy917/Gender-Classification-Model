@Infinimata Thank you I will try to use them just as a habit then it seems like mostly a preference thing ),1
@QuesoCaliente you might be able to use a portable install of Python on a USB stick to get around this. But don't do anything liable to get you fired :D,1
@Infinimata unfortunately not our work laptops are pretty locked down,0
hm. i guess you could try making Python programs on your phone...,0
@Vindicated thischannel isn't a meme or cartoon dump.,0
@Vindicated not here,0
though that doesn't seem like the greatest idea and in fact is probably the worst idea i have ever heard.,0
@fix error Amazon has rules against price tracking? Isn't that illegal not to be legal?@renagade You don't need an entire function for random_number. Also `import random` should be at the top of your python script not in the middle of a function,1
@Deleted User Amazon doesn't allow any kind of scraping,0
isn't the floor not made out of floor?,0
there are apps that are an ide for phones,0
@fix error That's crazy they don't allow that in my country. Every company must allow it so they don't cheat on sales like i.e. writing 50% OFF JUST TODAY!! when in reality the price has not changed or actually increased,1
@✪ SavagePastaMan Pydroid 3 is an example.,0
most are much worse than IDEs you can get on computers,0
does anyone know visual c sharp lol,0
@Deleted User anyway this server has its own rules not coupled to any country,0
other servers are too inactive to help,0
@Galena best to ask in an offtopic channel as this is chiefly a Python server,0
i do,0
we also have a channel specifically for Discord bots #discordbots,0
@fix error weird country america that\'s why every site says sale % off only today ends in xx:xx:xx hours! I guess,1
@ENVY₊₊ is that repl.it?,0
send link I can help you inside it,0
@PassiveAggressor the index is the position of the item regardless of what's in it.,0
theres also a discord.py server,0
dm the link btw or someone might troll,0
@ENVY₊₊ If `firstFrame` isn't `'yes'` then `secondFrame` will not be defined  and then you're trying to access `secondFrame`,0
.index gives the index of the first item equal to the argument if it exists,0
`.index` returns the index of the first occurence of the specified object,0
@ENVY₊₊ You need an `else` statement in there,0
`.count()` counts the number of occurrences.,0

Can somebody recommend a resource for learning SQL? Preferrably with python?,0
https://realpython.com/pythonsqllibraries/,0
SQLite comes with Python so that's a good place to start,0
Thanks!,0
@PassiveAggressor it's rare to use .index tbh,0
@ENVY₊₊ did you share your code?,0
@ENVY₊₊ how can we help if we can't see the code?,0
@PassiveAggressor why would it give 1?,0
why would it give 3?,0
why would you need every occurence,0
@PassiveAggressor `L[n]` gets the nth element.,0
no one will do your homework for you and requests for paid work are nott allowed,0
(starting at 0),0
really dude?,0
wow,0
!rule 6,0

that doesn't look like python,0
How would I detect (and remove) a certain part of my string if it includes a certain set of words?,0
and you can't prove something is true by showing cases that it is true,0
ah.,0
@PassiveAggressor show us,0
@Polar have you checked the repos linked in the hacktoberfest discord server?,0
@Supermania that's not even discrete math that's basic algebra,0
There is!,0
"BTW `print(f""{list[3]}"")` is better written as `print(list[3])`",0
you are crazy 🙂,0
`L[]` never finds the position,0
`L[n]` simply gets the item at position `n`,0
"!e```pyL = [""hello nedbat hi marc""]print(L[2]) # 2nd elementprint(L[0]) # 0th element```",0
@✪ SavagePastaMan :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```001 | hi002 | hello```,0
@Supermania ```Suppose n is even. Then n = 2k for some integer k.Suppose 3n + 7 is odd; then (3(2k) + 7) + 1 is even thus 3(2k) + 7 + 1 = 6k + 8 = 2(3k + 4) which is even therefore 3(2k) + 7 must be odd. QED```,1
@Zilcher intensive math is often done with numpy,0
"```pythonusers_unique_id = [""sub""] users_email = [""email""] users_picture = [""picture""] users_name = [""given_name""] return render_template( id=users_unique_id email=users_email picture=users_picture name=users_name)```is there a way i can unpack these variables straight into the render_template maybe by using  or something?",1

@Zilcher Yes? What kind of question is that? Almost all ML uses it,0
@Zilcher are you familiar with numpy?,0
I mean yes,0
"for like ```pyA = np.array([[2 1 5], [4 4 4], [1 3 1]])B = np.array([[1 1 5], [4 0 0], [1 0 1]])```For small matrix multiplications or gaussian elimitions it might not be much but ML uses hundreds of rows etc @Zilcher",1
Like triangular matrix,0
they can get huge and most things depend on O(n) complexity tbh,0
So it's not the language it depends on really you shouldn't compare it to C++ it's mostly the programmer themselves,0
can someone help me with this im in csc 101 and this shits hard af,0
How the hell do you code,0
Does anybody know,0
!resources @ClappingPotato @remmy check these out,0
,0
Someone knows about the solution for my problem? it's up this chat.,0
@ClappingPotato I've been wondering this too,0
@ClappingPotato nobody knows,0
Thanks,0
@ClappingPotato think hard about what you want the computer to do. break it into smaller pieces. Break those into smaller pieces write the smallest bits put them all together.,1
@remmy Depends on what type of programming you want to doComputer science? software engineering? data science? web developer?,0
@PassiveAggressor he's not wrong it's not written for beginners it's written for former c programmers,0
@brandonn I love that font,0
@marc what does that even mean,0
@marc never heard of it and I have no clue on how to use it,0
@PassiveAggressor a language interpreter is just a big program. why not write it in a good language?,0
@marc I gave him a bad version,0
imagine not using C,0
@Zilcher the Python compiler does very little to change your code,0
If I can't get an answer in this chat where should I go?,0
@PassiveAggressor no because it's very readable,0
@Deleted User see #❔｜howtogethelp,0
Thanks,0
there is an optimizer but it's very very simple,0
@Zilcher Well there's a lot of room for improvement. For example PyPy is a JIT compiler that speeds a lot of stuff but right now it's stuck at 3.6.In Python the compiler can't do very much because of python's dynamic nature.,1
How do i connect to a server with socketio,0
@Jac_k COBOL and SQL entered the chat 😛,0
> hey all. I'm currently in high school taking coding classes soon and would love to pursue a programming degree. Does anyone know of some good free classes I can take now until collage maybe. I know very little coding and a very very new person to python. all help is appreciated@remmy codecademy has some great free and paid stuff,1
very beginner friendly,0
@ntx02 codecademyis horrible don't recommend it,0
@Higgs how so?,0
Well unlike Python java has things which are not objects,0
my bad,0
whats so bad about codecademy?,0
That is true and its python interpreter doesn't let you use user input either,0
at least not when I used it,0
@ntx02 It depends on what you're trying to accomplish;Codecademy is definitely not good projectwise also there are better free options like freecodecampComputer Science career path for CC is terrible for example,1
should i use Flask or php :GWseremePeepoThink:,0
PyCharm is pretty great but I wouldn't say its best for beginners,0
@Deleted User Flask is a framework and PHP is a language  can't really compare them.,0
yeah i mean,0
Python ot PHP for web development,0
Anybody know how to make a trading bot that trades off of tradingview webhooks,0
I've actually never used IDLE,0
I've been content with vscode and jetbrains stuff,0
pycharm and webstorm,0
Wow the python server image is pretty fire.,0
Anyone got Flask tips,0
I just started learning it,0
Can someone help me with Socket plss,0
that looks great,0
it's fine someone just deleted their message,0
it will,0
PyCharm is great for developing big programs for Windows as well?,0
I pretty much use PyCharm as my main IDE,0
Basically importing the necessary modules into other modules,0
You can chain link modules right? I haven't tried it myself though,0
What I meant was...,0
File A imports into file B then File B imports into File C.,0
I was thinking of that earlier for a character generator program I'm working on,0
bro I cant read item 6,0
,0
@Winszy Have you tried coding it in your IDE to test the result?,0
That shit is hard to read man,0
To save memory space right?,0
LOL,0
Enhance.... Enhance.... ENHANCE! Lol,0
enhanced!,0
Bot C.,0
math 🤢,0
a = 3^2 is 6 + 2 equals 8,0
wait nvm thats easy math,0
Thus a = 8. 3 6 8,0
Basically a fill in for any number,0
^^^^,0
think of it like [x for x in range(whatever)],0
Yeah pretty much,0
same,0
Math notation doesn't bother me.,0
my calculus classes make me wanna put my head in a microwave,0
It's the abuse of notation in science that they use to measure relativity sound speed etc.,0
Oh man...,0
not as bad as my polymer chem classes tho lmao,0
Lol. Chemistry huh? That's a tough one,0
polymer chemistry should be considered a crime against humanity,0
yeah im stuck in this polymer chem major til i can transfer to comp sci,0
Is it a core requirement of Comp Sci where you're attending?,0
no my current major is Polymer and Color Chemistry,0
so I have to take polymer chem classes rn,0
until I can transfer majors,0
I see. So why switch to Comp Sci if you're studying that major?,0
I really enjoy comp sci and I really don't enjoy polymer chemistry,0
in hindsight wish I had just applied to comp sci in the first place,0
Yeah. I like programming a lot so I really don't see myself doing any other major except for business administration if I wanted to be a CEO one day.,1
I took some majors before I realized I'd like to do Comp Sci. Now I'm just in between hoping to get back into it to finish,1
@ntx02 you will be very valuable when you graduate,0
Yeah/.,0
Programmers are in need these days now.,0
Thats what I'm hoping,0
my point is you will know a lot about not programming,0
Such as @nedbat ?,0
as in more subject knowledge on things outside of programming?,0
such as polymer and color chemistry,0
Ah I see,0
@VimVim Does Seikatsu have a different view of that?,0
Can someone help me in #helpbanana,0
I need coding help ill pay $,0
@VimVim I like your name,0
I'm looking forward to hacktoberfest! Although I'm pretty bad at github,0
@VimVim you just make pull requests and get a free shirt,0
@Deleted User Definitely not the right place here. Try Fiverr Freelancer and other sites.,0
Well I will be missing out on the free shirt.,0
probably not that much,0
Well depends on when it starts. Even if it starts you'll have to make yourself fast enough to do it before 70K is up. I'll bet it dries up fast since a lot of programmers use GitHub,1
Yeah,0
The odds aren't that good.,0
whats a shorter way to say ```pythonif num % 3 or num % 4 or num % 5 != 0```,0
😄,0
Vim the English teacher here LOL,0
What are you trying to do with that code @Deleted User,0
@huscurian {GMT5} He wants a shorter way for it,0
check if num is divisible by 3 4 or 5,0
@VimVim 🤣 Dang... Seems like you are a big help to them,0
@VimVim If it's like last year you should have made your 4 PRs by the middle of the month to get a shirt,1
@Deleted User Do you require just one divisible to return true?,0
@Deleted User I'm not sure if there is any shorter way for that honestly 😄,0
> whats a shorter way to say ```python> if num % 3 or num % 4 or num % 5 != 0> ```@Deleted User that's really it actually,1
```pythonfor val in (3 4 5): return num % val```,0
i mean i guess that would work? lol,0
I mean you could do `any(num % mod for mod in [3 4 5])`,0
@Deleted User lol ig that would work,0
which is not really any more concise for only 3 numbers,0
Yeah it's how it would work since you're asking for any one of them.,0
```pythonall = [ ... ... ...]if all != 0:```Would that work?,0
@aka yee hi,0
"`print(""hi"")`",0
😄,0
@VimVim Yes I've participated last year and it was with free shipping in Europe. Also they put 1€ as the tax declaration so won't have to pay for customs in most cases,1
Ooof no problem,0
can u code real games with python?,0
```count from starting number to ending number and total the numbers counted if they are not evenly divisble by 3 4 or 5``` already solved the prompt just thought the way I did it was wordy,1
@𝕷𝖔𝕮𝖔 Yeah I get that he wants it shorter but I don't see how,0
@huscurian {GMT5} Yeah ig that is the only way he can do it honestly,0
anyone know how to send data with socketio?,0
@LoganTheDudeRox You should check out UE4,0
i'm almost positive there is a shorter way lol,0
@frownyfrog what is the math behind that?,0
Anyone experienced with Blockchain Programming in python we need a helping hand we found a new blockchain method.\\,0
@Deleted User I mean ofc but you gotta do a little research on it lol,0
> ok this  definitely> `if num % 60:`@frownyfrog oh yeah that is true,0
🥴,0
oh because they're all divisible by 3 4 and 5,0
wait,0
smart way of doing it doesn't neccesarily answer the general question but that is better lol,0
LOL,0
"Yup its gonna divide the num by 60 instead of each number that you want (3,4 and 5)",0
not divide,0
% gives a remainder honestly,0
yes that is modulus,0
yupp,0
@frownyfrog lol,0
🤷\u200d♂️ ?,0
OK guys,0
It was nice chatting with y'all. I better log off and head home. I'll be back here later.,0

how do u send a data with socketio,0
Hmm,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx You have asked your question dozens of times here just open a help channel and be patient; or ask in #networking,1
i did but no one answer me,0
And describe your problem more accurately: what exactly are you trying to do? (why do you need SocketIO in the first place?) what have you tried? what specifically you don't understand?,1
@ENVY₊₊ age < 16 why did you made it a string lol,0
I dont know how to get back the data or the response,0
with socketio module,0
I need Socketio for this API https://www.touchportal.com/api/index.php?section=dynamicactions,0
I don't think SocketIO is a very popular thing so just tell what you're trying to do (you're trying to access some API? why are you using SocketIO when there are better tools like `requests`?),1
i need to send a starter data then the program will response back then i can use that data to run my program,1
,0
guys please welcome @shitass to the python community!,0
,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx What have you tried? There are many ways to use sockets in python. If you are familiar with async `asyncio` provides very convenient tools for working with sockets.,1
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx dont use socketio it's 2020 not 2011,0
so what are other ways to talk with that api?,0
and get the response,0
why are people suggesting sockets? can you not use `requests.post`?,0
Yes. `asyncio`'s socket client. `import asyncio` is a very wellmade youtube series it explains asyncio indepth and creates an example app using asyncio's socket utilities. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbl7XjFYsN4>,1
XD,0
@Deleted User `requests` is for making HTTP requests.,0
anyone has a fast ass ban js script?,0
so asyncio can do the same as Socketio right?,0
Never used socketio in my life. `asyncio` provides very convenient ways of communicating via sockets at least compared to the builtin `sockets` module.,1
its not an http request hes making? my b,0
nope it's Socketio thing,0
hi,0
I'm new,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx Once you are able to figure out how to receive and send data you will be able to talk to that API. Touch Portal also has a Discord server maybe you can ask there.,1
also this: <https://discord.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/761047885440614471> @! xXKiller_BOSSXx,0

"@Azrael616 This is a very long and convoluted line  it\'s almost impossible to find an error here. That won\'t work though: `print(...)` returns `None` and you can\'t use `+` on it. `time.sleep` returns `None` as well and you can\'t add it to a string.What you can do is call `print(character end="""")` and then sleep all in a loop",1
@eus4lgar You can claim a help channel.,0
(see #❔｜howtogethelp ),0
I can't find anything about Asyncio,0
wait that's streams,0
ohhhhhh,0
WHAT 100% idk how async work,0

@Tu®tle for the problem you helped me with earlier I am actually confused by how the result is being generated ```pythonif all(x%y for y in (3 4 5)):``` how exactly is `all` determining if something mod something is True or False?,1
My brain dies everytime i look at the long lengthy texts LOL,0
@Zilcher That's not what they're asking,0
"@Julian @Deleted User You can use ```pyif all(x % y > 0 for y in (3 4 5)):```All values in Python are truthy or falsey"". When used as a condition for `if` or in some other contexts nonboolean values are converted into booleans.So for example `0` is falsey `[]` is falsey `""""` is falsey etc.  empty containers and empty values in general are treated as `False`.",1

@at What are you referring to? There's probably too many things you can play around with in Python classes (metaclasses descriptors dynamically creating classes reflection etc.),1
Ah that’s interesting. How large of a file would that yield for something with 13k variables dumped,0
nice!! happy to see iit isnt hello world @Deleted User,0
@Soviet Spy you'd save out the model in a binary format that's compatible with the framework in question.,0

> Can I check if a value actually is an `int` and not a `bool`?> ```py> >>> isinstance(True int)> True> ```> Should I use `type`?@Urkchar you'll have yo do both checks,1
For int and bool,0
It is a bit tricky to differentiate between 1 and True and 0 and False. May not be obvious at first,1
list.append is a thing right?,0
then why cant os[s]da,0
ohh,0
@gappa if you want to give back you can donate to our Patreon  that was you will give money to the server not a random bot that grabs your stuff.,1
@Urkchar `bool` is a subclass of `int` unfortunately. Well you can do `isinstance(True int) and not isinstance(True bool)`.( You can also make a `IntButNotBool` class with an overridden subclass check (so that `isinstance(42 IntButNotBool) is True and isinstance(True IntButNotBool) is False` but that's a very #esotericpython thing to do. ),1
Why do we have DigitalOcean intel and dev on the banner,0
> It's Hacktoberfest@PureFunctor what does that mean?,0
@Urkchar `type(0) is int`,0
> @fix error I ended up doing it like this.> ```py> valid_a = isinstance(a int) and type(a) == type(0)> valid_b = isinstance(b int) and type(b) == type(0)> ```@Urkchar if you wanted to do that you might as well just do `type(a) is int`,1
You could do `isinstance(b int) and not isinstance(b bool)` or `type(b) is int`,0
which is fine if you never intend to pass an `int` subclass,0
(and honestly most people don't),0
> I was told that I was only supposed to use `type` for debugging but I couldn't think of a way without it.@Urkchar the canonically quoted reason is that you want to support subclasses too,1
How does hacktoberfest work and how can i take part?,0
then just do `isinstance(a int) and type(a) is not bool`,0
is there a module or an import that can chek for proper nouns in a list and remove them or remove everythong else,1
> is there a module or an import that can chek for proper nouns in a list and remove them or remove everythong else@💫 | Loess what do you consider a proper noun?,1
like a name,0
or a place like a city,0
precisely.,0
it's not easy to define.,0
> it's 😐,0
you could use some sort of heuristic and there probably are models for that but it's not a simple problem relatively speaking,1
oh okay,0
yeah just use `type(a) is not bool`,0
noice new symbol,0
> Well but `type() is X` is not equivalent to `isinstance()`@ManchaNegra but you cannot subclass `bool`.,0
so you should use `isinstance` for the `int` comparison but `type(a) is bool` is fine,0
(I mean there's `__instancecheck__` but that kind of violates the `bool` invariant anyway so),0
....,0
> but type will also work right?@NonchalantNorman `type` checks exact type equality,0
> hm@NonchalantNorman ```py>>> class A:... pass...>>> class B(A):... pass...>>> isinstance(B() A)True>>> type(B) == AFalse```,0
but you can't subclass `bool` so in that specific case `type(a) is not bool` is okay,0
okay the main thing you should take away is,0
unless you know what you're doing `isinstance` is better than `type`,0
how to install modules into vs?,0

@💫 | Loess It should be available if you pip install and your vscode is pulling the correct interpreter,0

@Deleted User `.blit()` wants something like:```pywin.blit(whatever (x_pos y_pos))```,0
oh ok,0
Notice the extra set of parentheses around the x_pos and y_pos. That means you're passing in a tuple with x_pos and y_pos as the values in that tuple.,1

convert input to string convert split string to int,0
you cant call int on a list,0
no youre learning were helping.,0
oh yea,0
good point,0
is map object unpackable ?,0
you need to take int( index 0 of the list) and add it to the int(1),0
split returns a list,0
A map,0
A cat,0
Is to create a relationship between two things,0
A cat is to make people happy,0
If you map an apple to a banana then the domain of your map is the apple,0
map is a way to pass each value in an iterable throgh a function and it returns a map object,0
Ohhhhh,0
i think map is a generator. i am not sure though,0
What about generators?,0
Take this example `map(int ['1 2 3'])` what this does it does int(x) for x in ['1 2'. 3'],0
I have read the documentation of the re module in pythonI would want to know if there\'s a way of matching all the words that I want with a pattern AND see the .span() (Indexes of those word in the strings) of each word.I tried with re.findall() but just returns a list with all the matches but not a match object which contains a span atributte.,1
I have actually practice a lot on the re module,0
you get a list of (not actually a list) everything that is returned,0
Snake share your code,0
it is a list like structure . but not a list (MAP) you can loop through the values,0
but you can't say smtg like a[0] on a map object,0
"```pythonimport rea_string = italic this too""pattern = r\'[]\\w+[]\'print(re.findall(pattern a_string))```I want a re method which gives me a list of objects (type match) so they have a .span attribute and I can check for the ubication of each word in the string.OUTPUT:```console[\'italic\ \'too\']```Instead I receive a list of strings whose don\'t have a .span attribute.",1
because you can pass it a fuction and a list(any iterable actually) and it will return what the fuction returned in each iteration,1
This is not my actual program my program would check for each word break the string in those .span() indexes change a part from the word (say those ) with something like <i> and then join everything back together @𝕷𝖔𝕮𝖔  that's why I need the Indexes,1
Hi,0
it is almost equal to `[int(i) for i in ['1 2 3']]`,0
@Deleted User sorry for the late reply i fell asleep but my mind dead rn so i will look at it tomorrow and you can ask everyone else for now,1
the difference is the in the map object all values aren't caluculated when that code in run it is just run when you need it.,1

@Deleted User if you find some examples related to it then it will help you out,0

I think yours might be faster by a tiny bit,0
Because no func call overhead,0
i did the list comp way for him becuase he couldn't understand the mapobject,0
but it's basically the same,0
both faster than a list comp tho,0
lmao,0
he was printing the map object and expecting to see [1 2]  that's why i had to go with list comp,1
omg python is so scary 😮😲😱,0

hello guys any1 here new to python im learning rn dm me and lets be code buddies!!,0
im just a week into python but i know a somewhat decent amount i feel like im using python crash course i do abt an hour a day,1
"can someone check my code```pythonimport asyncioimport websocketsasync def Socket_Server(websocket path): receve = await websocket.recv() print(receve)websockets.serve(Socket_Server 127.0.0.1 12136)async def message(): pair = \'{""type"":""pair"",""id"":""jwdr4""}\' async with websockets.connect(""ws://127.0.0.1:12136"") as socket: await socket.send(pair) message = await websocket.recv() print(message)asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(message())asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(start_server1)asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()```",1

it does nothing...,0
check that u missed print(message) something or yea,0
i do that sometimes i type the code but forget to print it,0
do u use sublime text?,0
whats sublime?,0
do u have any text interpreter lmao,0
i like sublime text 3 its awesome nice and organized,0
oh i just use pythons default editor,0
No it's corporate greed is what it is,0

Why isn't python preinstalled on windows,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx ok i used sublime and it says u have an error on line 12 and 18,0
This is wrong,0
hmm what are the errors? @Deleted User,0
module error for line 18 and message error for line 12,0

tbh,0
use sublime text 3 search up how to install it,0
i can't install anything because i am on hotspot and download speed is like 12kb lol,0

im 4 days into learning python lol i barely know shit i just know basic stuff as of rn,0

i've been using python for like a week now,0
i use thius python crash course book its 500 pages im 40 pages in,0
Wow,0
i just do an hour a day but this book is literally awesome,0
oh i do this all day idk why lol,0
this book makes coding what i used to think as a scary beast and something that will take years to learn as something that is not too bad,1
wha tbook @Deleted User,0
i actually think an hour a day is much better than like 6 hours a day because it makes ur info retainment high which is why i like it,1
,0
i do like 812hrs a day on python lol,0
i do an hour a day but do lots of review and add notes to all of my code that i write its really helpful to look back on it,1
dude thats awesome i only do an hour kindve wana do more but i dont wana foget the stuff i learn so yea,1
that's better lol i always forget so i just look back to the doc,0
yea im planning on getting more books after this one i already got one im so hyped im gonna do these all throughought high school hopefully i can suceed in software engineering,1

how ?,0
It wasn't a serious suggestion.,0
That would be a lot of work for no benefit.,0
> how high can it go without crashing?@Fish Knight I can use 100000 without crash,0
what does async and await do ?,0
does it work like javascript async and await,0
@Kronos It's very similar yes.,0
no..,0
Hehehe),0
async and await will work without any extra modules ?,0
Why is that ?,0
> shouldmm't the os limit the amount of memory?@clavlav12 Idk but it works how its work),0
@clavlav12 I think OS is trying to allocate memory from the hard disk buffer but this is also missing,0
@Kronos async and await are Python keywords. But you generally want asyncio for various utilities.,0
Okay..,0
You don't strictly need it though.,0
Confusing,0
@Kronos Well actually you might need asyncio to actually run your asynchronous program.,0
i have to say asyncio.run(function) ? damn so how would i pass it as a callback to another fuction ?,0
@Kronos What do you mean pass it as a callback?,0
the function that i want to make as asyc will be called from another function. it will be a parameter to another function,1
yay i got the hackerrank certificate,0
can someone suggest me more things like that or momre websites where i could get certificates and omprove my skills,0
@Kronos It works like in JS. You can await an async function but only inside an async function. You can trigger your toplevel async function with async.run. There are also functions for calling async functions concurrently in asyncio.,1
Okay.. i am gonna read the doc! thank everyone,0
> can someone suggest me more things like that or momre websites where i could get certificates and omprove my skillsimprove,1
@Kronos Aside from that there's nothing special. You can pass an async function as a parameter to another function but you can only await it from inside an async function.,1
Hmm,0
@Kronos async func working like this:Your func You create coroutinemain coroutine You add this coroutine in tasks list with asyncio.create_task  You run tasks list with asyncio.gatheryou run main coroutine in asyncio.run,1

@GRIFFITH OF FARADAY Are you familiar with pip?,0
How can I open a new page when I press a button in pyqt5,0
@GRIFFITH OF FARADAY Right. So when you install a Python package with pip it will install it to a systemwide repository. So any Python script anywhere in your computer can use it.,1
What is the difference between @classmethod and @Deleted Usermethod,0
Has anyone handled sessions with FastAPI?,0
@GRIFFITH OF FARADAY This can be problematic if you have two different Python projects that rely on the same library but require different versions of it.,1
@GRIFFITH OF FARADAY Additionally your OS might rely on certain Python scripts to function properly and those might also require specific versions of dependencies.,1
it wont be an error must be a warning,0
@GRIFFITH OF FARADAY A venv is basically an isolated package environment. You can create one for a specific project and when you install stuff with pip inside it those packages will only be available in that project.,1
@GRIFFITH OF FARADAY That way there is no risk of different versions of packages colliding between projects.,0
help me,0
@GRIFFITH OF FARADAY If you delete the venv the packages you installed inside it goes with it yes. But not if you just deactivate it. The venv is stored on disk.,1
not using a variable can cause an error ?,0
@GRIFFITH OF FARADAY What OS are you using?,0
The program will still run right?,0
and why would you want variables that you don't use ?,0
@GRIFFITH OF FARADAY I\'m not on Windows so I can\'t test it but try opening and activating the venv in a cmd.exe window and type where python,1
That might tell you where the venv Python executable is located on disk,0
Which should be inside the venv directory,0
If you delete the venv directory that will delete the venv,0
@GRIFFITH OF FARADAY Is there any particular reason why you want to delete it?,0
requests.get() can be run async right ?,0
You're welcome,0
download pip and add it to path,0
then just do `pip version` to check it,0
do you get any error?,0

idk I don't use windows,0

yeah that was when I was a rookie,0
@Avangunite did you try the link I sent?,0

I sell 165 apples at $1.40 per apple. My accounting software uses floating point numbers for the calculation.>>> 165  1.40230.99999999999997^ float,1
Yes,0
It's because only certain real numbers can be represented accurately as floats.,0
So when you do arithmetics with floats you will inevitably get certain errors that need to be dealt with.,0
You can round it,0
Since money usually deals with discrete values (you don't normally have to handle fractions of a cent) it makes more sense to store the amount as an integer in cents.,1
@Deleted User Yes it's possible but it's way more bugprone.,0
> Does this language have arrays? Or just tuples and Lists?@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] it does,0
> @Deleted User Yes it's possible but it's way more bugprone.@dementati I think so,0
I think tuples are represented as C arrays in CPython.,0
Or wait no,0
The most common Python implementation.,0
If you just download Python off the website you're installing CPython.,0

@Deleted User i know that but i am using sprites not rect,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] Python is garbage collected so heap memory is automatically allocated and deallocated as needed.,0
somebody pls help me,0
@helpnitrogen,0
> @Deleted User i know that but i am using sprites not rect@Deleted User Maybe you can ask for help in a help channel,1
There are no pointers but objects are passed by reference so they aren\'t really needed.,0
i did,0
sorry,0
> i did@Deleted User Oh,0
how can i fix the rect promblem?,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] In CPython lists are implemented as dynamic arrays as I recall so they consist of a linked sequence of arrays and the elements are pointers to Python objects.,1
N,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] Since Python lets you store different types in the same list you can't store the values directly in the array in the C implementation.,1
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] You can't and you don't need to.,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] Lists are already stored on the heap for example.,0
@guy_frm_yogaland It's good and it's fast.,0
how can i fix the rect problem,0
@guy_frm_yogaland I'm not wellversed in the differences so I can't really comment on that.,0
"@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] `print(f""Here\'s a value: {some_variable}"")`",0

"!e ```pya = one""print(f""Heres {a} example"")```",0
@dementati :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```Heres one example```,0
You can put any expression inside the {} not just variables.,0
@guy_frm_yogaland There is an older syntax that looks more similar to C but fstrings are generally better.,0
@guy_frm_yogaland I'm not familiar with jinja sorry,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] The downside is that it's slower.,0
And sometimes dynamic typing is not actually a good thing.,0
@guy_frm_yogaland Yeah I have very little experience with Django.,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] In some implementations you _can_ manipulate memory if you _reallyreally_ want to but this is the most sure way to shoot yourself in the foot as the language wasn't designed with that in mind.,1
i need help,0
something in the introduce() is subscripting a built in functioni dont know what that means or how to fix it,0
,0
wait is it too zommed out,0
the introduce is making an error,0
> wait is it too zommed out@💫 | Loess For sure,0
@kloceg Can you be more specific?,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] Well there are still some memory caveats for example in CPython (the default implementation) recursion is limited to 1000 levels deep and you will get a `RecursionError` if you violate that.,1
@kloceg You mean to check if something is not equal to something else?,0
!=,0
> wait is it too zommed out@💫 | Loess your visual studio code looks weird,0
> Well there are still some memory caveats for example in CPython (the default implementation) recursion is limited to 1000 levels deep and you will get a RecursionError if you violate that.I mean the alternative is a segfault which you can get if you manually raise the recursion limit,1
,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] It's just the implementation of the Python interpreter.,0
> @💫 | Loess your visual studio code looks weird@Inheritance ♦ its not vs code and its custom colors 🙂,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] No that would be Cython (mixture of C and Python kind of?)  it may be a bit confusing. CPython is the reference implementation of Python,1
CPython is to python what gcc is to C,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] If you download the interpreter from the website that executable was implemented in C and it's called CPython.,0
There are other alternative Python implementations as well like PyPy.,0
Pypi you mean dementati,0
no pypy,0
oh,0
welp sorry,0
pypi is the python package index,0
well you probably don't need Cython now,0
also can anyone help me on this?,0
some bug in the introduce() function,0
i know but it's a different thing than pypi,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] Cython iirc is a framework for writing actual C programs with a Pythonlike syntax or something along those lines.,1

that would be nuitka @lgneous,0

but it is highlighting the colon between the model and name @cmyui,0
but i assume i can't just put my stricyly relaying python code through a magic black box that converts it to CPython code? i saw that besides some functions being different that it also uses a different coding structure?,1
i did now,0
still the same error,0
@lakmatiol Thanks man! can i borrow your brain ?,0
Wait there are 2 versions?,0
umh. i think Cython the code optimizer?,0
whats the difference then,0
so what should i do with it?,0
new logo?,0
@Linus Isn't it an older version of Python?,0
right so i can't just put existing python code and convert it to cython,0
Existing Python code will compile as Cython but will not have any appreciable performance gains,0
then what is the use in compiling it?,0
^^^^^ Help this booyy,0
right,0
You need to add type annotations to Cython to yield any significant performance improvements. I have a demo I wrote a Conway's Game Of Life app that uses Cython for speedups  the Cython version runs about 500 times faster,1
The biggest speedups for Cython are in numerical code.,0
@Infinimata i saw an illustration video about that.,0
i know cython has like a script/file that shows you which parts of your code are still inefficient and such. Does such script exist for regular python indicating inefficent stuff in your code?,1
there are profilers that you can use,0
what is fython?,0
profiler not sure what that is,0
i know pycharm pro has a profiler built in which is nice,0
@Deleted User `cProfile` can be used to perform functionlevel profiling in Python; that's included with it. There's other profilers that do things differently,1
@lakmatiol is there a way to get the event that is being passed by `on_press` in the function in my thread ?,1
!paste,0
,0
!resources @MC_Silbermann,0
,0
are there any web profiles or how to use the exisitng cprofiler?,0
@Deleted User here's a simple one https://pythonspot.com/pythonprofiling/,0
but the docs for `cProfile` have far more details,0
interesting,0
it shows inefficiencies does it also show how to make it more efficient or is that black magic 🙂,0
,0
@Deleted User making it faster is on you these tools can only show you what needs improvement.,0
ok i ran it,0
but what does it tell me lol ```117239 0.045 0.000 0.045 0.000 {method startswith of str objects}``` example,0
@Deleted User read the documentation.,0
well i get that it shows me the time and calls but... that's not pointing to anything?,0
@Deleted User it's saying that amount of time and number of calls was used by calls to the `.startswith` method,0
again read the docs. this is all explained there,0
,0
"@lakmatiol You remember the code i sent earlier ? in that on_press passes an event parameter to the lambda fuction right.? which we didn't use at all .. is there a way to get access to that in the function inside my thread (`self.download`) as a param ?```py thread = threading.Thread(target=self.download args=(video['id'],)) button = Button(text='Download', size_hint=(.3 .3), pos_hint={'center_x': .5 center_y': .5}  on_press= lambda ev thisThread=thread :thisThread.start() )```",1
i read the docs but it only tells executing time/executed amounts not where this is all being messed up?,0
for example the cython version showed a text file with the code with color coding on what is efficient and what isnt,1
@Deleted User the idea is that you can see how much time your code is spending on any given thing. that's an indication as to where its bottlenecks may lie. it also shows you what's being called most often so that might give you some idea of what kinds of calls can be minimized.,1
@Deleted User right but this works differently. cProfile can be used on Cython as well to the same effect  showing you number and duration of calls.,1
right but most of the stuff shown in the python profiler is executions from libraries which is literally a pain to debug,1
@Deleted User you can filter those out. again read the documentation. it explains how to narrow down the scope of you profiling. you don't have to profile everything either; you can just profile a given function or module if that's what you need to focus on.,1
will do thanks,0
This is good right?,0
is inicializing all the variables I'll use for a project a good idea?,0
Nobody learns very much in a day. Take it slow and pace yourself,0
> @Deleted User I don't think you need to initialize any variables that stuff happens in languages like C++ and C. Here you can create objects on the spot when you need@pratt thank you,1

@PureFunctor Yeah before Python is gradually replaced with Haskell,0
Tabled,0
I think it could be the path,0
1  110? isn't that the same thing as if imgNumber == 109,0
Try adding the directory of images in the same directory as your index.py,0
Yes also that maybe you should try if (number  110) < 0,0
Right that is much better,0
doing (number  110) < 0,0
what about `if 1 <= img_number <= 110:`,0
I don't understand the conditional lemonade,0
hmm what about just simply say if imgNumber == number  110?,0
it will,0
It's a cool feature of python,0
imgNumber == imgNumber  100 will never be true,0
@Tabled don't add the == sign,0
just the expression I typed,0
Also that path is really strange.,0
Try adding the folder into the same folder in which your index.py is running,0
@Tabled You have to understand what you actually want to check. You want to check that `imgNumber` is at least 1 and `imgNumber` is less than 110.,1
hm not sure,0
and change the path to RacconPics\\{0}.jpg'.format(imgNumber),0

@Deleted User If you want to log in with discord into your web app it's not done with Python or any Python library. Python was not made to run on a web page it's just that there are few libraries that transpile Python to JS with varying success.,1

`enemyY_change` is probably a function. are you sure you didn't mean `enemyY_change()` that is the result of running that function?,0

@Oi that sounds like the application's throwing an error which you're not seeing because the console window you're using to run the program is also closing. launch a cmd line then run the program from there so the console window doesn't close. This is a common beginner's issue,1
yea,0
@Oi for starters are you using an IDE or editor?,0
argh I'm not familiar with it. there should be some controls within PyCharm to let you run things with a console window within the editor so you can see any errors thrown,1
It's a good IDE I just don't use it,0
Visual Studio Code with the Python addons,0

hey! When I am hosting my discord bot why does my bot shut down when I invite it on a different server? Im using python,1
@RollingRocky360 Will search for it thanks,0
@Deleted User `eval` is not a good idea as it can allow people to pass entirely untrusted input to your program,1
I just want a program to use it myself,0
eval is beautiful,0
To automate testing quadratic functions,0
What could I use then?,0
`copy.deepcopy` @Tavis,0
@Deleted User for something like that there might be an existing library that helps you solve quadratics,0
(I'm not well versed in math so I can't say but it might be worth poking around for something close to your use case),1
infinitemata,0
@Infinimata When my bot is in more than 1 server why does it shut down? Im using python,0
@Tavis you could assign another name to point at the same object but that's not a copy,0
My teacher says for example solve the following equations:f(x) = 6 ^ xg(x) = 10 ^ x  2,0
I want to input those functions and let the program do the job,0
@Deleted User sorry I know nothing about bots can't help. Try #discordbots if that's what you're using,0
Not quadratic functions specificaly my bad at explaining the problem.,0
I think I'm going to use eval thanks for the help.,0
@Deleted User well it's possible but again entirely at your own risk.,0
Putting time.sleep(0) in a while true loop reduces the CPU usage it says on the internet but for me it actually increased with ca 5%? Anyone has an idea why this is?,1
@Skynse Lool,0
I don't want to specify each function every time,0
@Deleted User it would be hard to say why without seeing more code.,0
It is a while true loop with 1 if statement,0
I'll do someting to probe that I don't,0
Taking up 45% of my CPU usage,0
@Deleted User again without actually seeing code impossible to say more,0
Stay tuned,0
With time.sleep(0) it is 50%,0
why are you adding `time.sleep` to it in the first place?,0
@LightSpdRunner such things are not optimized out.,0
The internet says that reduces CPU usage,0
@Deleted User the internet is wrong.,0
Cuz of thread yield,0
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/787803/howdoesathreadingthreadyieldtherestofitsquantuminpython,0
Cuz of how CPU prioritization works,0
that thread is 11 years old.,0

Resulting the CPU usage for the while true thread,0
hi,0

@Deleted User what are you trying to do in the loop?,0

So I want the code to execute every minute so it checks if a minute passed,0
@Deleted User if you're trying to do something on an interval that's not the way to go about doing it I'm sorry to report,1
that\'s called busywaiting and it\'s to be avoided at all costs,0
Busy waiting?,0
running a tight loop and waiting for a certain time to elapse.,0
if you want to do something every minute the most general solution is to have the script/task in question launched by your operating system's task scheduler (`cron` in Linux),1
Yes that is what I am doing I searched A LOT on how to do it different but this is what I came up with,1
Yes I got advised to use the scheduled tasks stuff,0
But that has proven to be inefficient/compatible with my program,0
@Deleted User if oyu must wait in a loop then you do this: you do the actions needed then sleep for the total time you want to wait for instead of sleeping 0 seconds at a time and checking the time over and over again.,1
another option is to use threading which lets you pause and resume threads on demand,0
Yes but I need it to be second perfect,0
can anyone help?,0
idk where the help channel is,0
for normal python,0
#❔｜howtogethelp @! ! ! ! Jerry,0
I don’t think threading waiting will help,0
one other way to do this: take note of the current time. run your functions take note of the time elapsed since the function started. sleep for the difference between that and 1 second. repeat.,1
Yes I was thinking of that too i’d have to test how accurate that runs though,0
Is time sleeping not busy waiting then?,0
Gn,0
@Deleted User that's about as accurate as you're going to get assuming your function doesn't take longer than 1 second to complete.What you were doing before was sleeping for 0 seconds which is pointless. The whole point of sleeping is to suspend the running thread for a certain period of time.,1
So time sleep isn’t busy waiting?,0
I'll help Jerry,0
time.sleep has nothing to do with busy waiting as such. You were busywaiting before you ever added time.sleep to things,0
@Skynse,0
This was what I wanted,0
Ok I will try time sleep then thanks.,0

You can’t unhash something. You would have to encrypt it if you want to be able to reverse it,0

If you think learning C# is the next fun step sure dive right in. My friend just got started with programming using C# so I think it’ll work out. If that wasn’t a language you enjoy you’ll always be able to get back to python @Dolphin,1
As long as you enjoy the process 😄,0
how do i make my console print letter by letter?,0
yea but it didn't work for me,0
well for my program specifically,0
he tried to help me in dms but he doesn't know,0
is there any other way to do that,0
Aah alright. If you ever feel like it isn’t right feel free to change path,0
@LightSpdRunner what are you talking about??,0
Using trial and error — testing and evaluating — doesn’t mean that you don’t know enough of the language,0
What matters in the long run is keeping up the motivation and doing the things you enjoy doing. That’s what let’s you go far — not memorizing some FizzBuzz solution,1
I’d say this is on the topic of python. Trying out new languages doesn’t require “true understanding” either for that sake,1
@yardshop yes I agree,0
Anyone know how to get response data back? With Socket module,0
what issue did you have with it? @BoB,0
```python with open(self.file r') as convert_file: for line in convert_file: converting_line = line for rule in markdown_rules: if rule[0](converting_line): converting_line = rule[1](converting_line) converted_lines.append(converting_line)```Apparently not all the rules are being applied even if in the same line two words match just the first one is changed I have verified other functions but I think it's this piece of code what is causing the problem.Rule is a list of 2 functions BTW the first function searchs for matches in the line and the second one replaces what it has to replace.,1
that's a helpful screenshot,0
,0
pycharm is a great ide lol,0
It isn't shitty 🙂,0
@BoB if you say more about what you didn't like about pycharm it might be easier to recommend an alternative,0
do it in the command line,0
`git add` then `git commit`,0
@BoB what is the issue?,0
@BoB could you show your code if it isn't large?,0
"```pythonimport remarkdown_symbol = \'\'def match_rule(line): return fullsearch(r\'[\ + markdown_symbol[0] +r\']{\ + str(len(markdown_symbol)) + r\'}\\w+[\ + markdown_symbol[0] +r\']{\ + str(len(markdown_symbol)) + r\'}\ line [])def apply_rule(line): line = line.strip() total_matches_in_line = match_rule(line) print(total_matches_in_line) for match in total_matches_in_line: word = line[match.span()[0]:match.span()[1]] word = re.sub(r\'^[]{1}\  \'<i>\ word) word = re.sub(r\'[]{1}$\ \'</i>\ word) line = line[:match.span()[0]] + word + line[match.span()[1]:] return linedef fullsearch(pattern string a_list verified = False): \'\'\' Grabs a pattern a string and a list.

How could I code it so it works the way I want it to.,0
Why it doesn't return what I wanted?,0
regex isn't really suitable for parsing that),0
> how on earth does anyone know what you want@rie Ehm because I wrote what I expected?,0
Full code is 125 lines long I minimized it if won't help don't talk.,0
can someone tell me how do we use pygame code if it is written in C?,0
@Ovicron Python can wrap C code and make it available in Python programs,0
@Infinimata oh i didnt know that interesting,0
I want to use the function apply_rule(line) to change the  for the HTML_tags version of it.In this case apply_rule('\\italic\\ and \\italic\\') should return <i> italic </i> and <i> italic </i>'@eager,1
@apopathodiaphulatophobia it's faster certainly but less convenient to work with. Hence the Python wrapper,0
@Deleted User I would say it again  regex isn't suitable for that stuff,0
Python has many mechanisms for working conveniently with C,0
Can anyone suggest the best way to learn python.,0
does anyone here know much about discord bots? if so dm me i need to ask some questions. Thank you,0
@Deleted User build projects of your own that you have some personal connection to and use those as your repository for your learning,1
@Deleted User 48656c6c436154 #discordbots is the best channel for such questions,0
ill post it in there and see what happens thanks @Infinimata,0
```pythonimport redef match_rule(line): return fullsearch(r\'[]{1}\\w+[]{1}\ line [])def apply_rule(line): line = line.strip() total_matches_in_line = match_rule(line) print(total_matches_in_line) for match in total_matches_in_line: word = line[match.span()[0]:match.span()[1]] word = re.sub(r\'^[]{1}\  \'<i>\ word) word = re.sub(r\'[]{1}$\ \'</i>\ word) line = line[:match.span()[0]] + word + line[match.span()[1]:] return linedef fullsearch(pattern string a_list verified = False): verified = True search = re.search(pattern string re.VERBOSE) if search == None: return a_list a_list.append(search) if string != \'\':  string = string[search.span()[1]:] return fullsearch(pattern string a_list verified) else: return a_listprint(apply_rule(\'italic and italic\'))```When using print(apply_rule(\'\\italic\\ and \\italic\\\')) I want it to return  <i> italic </i> and <i> italic </i>(Minimized),1
@eager I verified each regex with the examples,0
It does match what I want it to,0
> @Deleted User You are probably exiting the loop sooner than you believe.@eager I was thinking the same but don't understand why,1
@BoB your issue doesn't seem like it's about the IDE at all. if you provide more details we can probably help fix it.,1
@eager,0
printed the word in each for iteration once it has replaced everything that was printed.,0
@Jac_k i have that book and the python crash course 2nd edition,0
what are some good books for more intermediate level python coders after i finish a few decent begineer ones,0

Maybe that would help,0
How do I import from a variable?,0
@atlas_core wdym,0
"If my valuable is args how do I import from args""?",0
What do you mean `import`,0
,0
`args` is a parameter,0
you already have access to it,0
yeah I'm trying to pass the parameter into the import command.,0
For what?,0
programs,0
,0
@atlas_core you can use the `__import__` function but this might be more trouble than it's worth. Why are eyou checking?,0
@atlas_core you're better off writing a setup.py that will just install them and assume it works.,0
even then how do I use pip inside a script?,0
and that wouldn't help my specific case.,0
@atlas_core ```pyprint('YOUR_MODULE in (pkg.key for pkg in pkg_resources.working_set))```,0
@atlas_core you can call pip in a script if you need to but why are you calling pip in a script?,1
@eager wdym?,0
isn't that the purpose of a setup.py?,0
@atlas_core your setup.py declares the dependencies and then when pip installs your code pip also installs your dependencies,0
@rie pip won't look at your requirements file,0
I'm not trying to install my program through pip..?,0
@eager `print(apply_rule('italic and italic'))``<i>italic</i><i>italic</i>`,0
I'm super confused.,0
oh.,0
and yeah it's missing and,0
yeah,0
Anyway regex isn't suitable for parsing stuff,0
,0
i just realized that the only nonstandard lib I would have is Discord.py.,0
why?,0
@Find me py,0
@Find me try `py 0p` and see what that reports,0
,0
how do i fix pip,0
`py m pip install flask` should work then. Also note that you have the 32bit version of Python installed; this may cause problems,1
Anyway yeah how would I use pip inside a script?,0
or should I not do that?,0
@Find me you may want to remove the version of Python you have and replace it with this versionhttps://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.3/python3.8.3amd64.exe,0
and be sure to check add Python to PATH during the install process.,0
@atlas_core You probably shouldn't do that unless you really have to,0
@atlas_core you don't need to call pip inside your script.,0
@eager I found this but I don't know how to interpretate it.,0
Something broke up in the second word,0
@2 x N your existing copy of Python is probably not installed correctly.,0
@eager yep,0
> @atlas_core you don't need to call pip inside your script.@nedbat then how would i proceed if I don't need to call pip from the script?,1
did you select add Python to PATH during the Python setup process?,0
@eager I found the problem,0
,0
that's why @2 x N,0
@2 x N that is typically the reason for these kinds of issues.,0
The second match object doesn't have correct indexes,0
Thanks @eager,0
@2 x N also you're running the 32bit version of Python which can cause problems.,0
@2 x N remove that version then1. Get the 64bit Python installer: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.3/python3.8.3amd64.exe2. Run the installer and be sure to check add Python to PATH during the install process.,1
for command lines always add them to your PATH it'll save you so much time.,0
i say this from experience,0
@atlas_core setup.py is a specialized thing.,0
(I'm getting really annoyed that the default Python download always seems to be the 32bit version which makes no sense in 2020),1
@nedbat oh?,0
Now I have to think about it,0
@2 x N YW and good luck,0
oh.,0
@∬starnar∬ I had my own projects in mind and I just kept at it until I could produce something vaguely resembling what I had in mind,1
setup.py is something a lot more different than i thought.,0
@Deleted User Hey could you try this?```pydef apply_rule(string: str): string = string.strip() return re.sub(r'\\(\\w+)\\ r'<i>\\1<i/> string)```,0
@atlas_core https://godatadriven.com/blog/apracticalguidetousingsetuppy/,0
Thanks a lot! I will give it a read.,0
@Doctor will do,0
replace <i/> with </i>,0
@Deleted User,0
that works,0
aaaaahhh hours and hours and didn't worked,0
xd,0
even created a function thanks @Doctor xD,0
Hours and hours of work > Someone does it in one line,0
I don't understand the solution if you could explain it i'll be happier.,0
@Doctor That usually happens when you're learning,0
@2 x N use this link to download the installer: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.3/python3.8.3amd64.exe,0
Might go to the library first time in about 5 years to get a book on python,0
(I keep that link handy because a lot of people end up needing it),0
Find `\\(\\w+)\\` pattern capture (\\w+) group replace it with `<i>\\1</i>` where \\1 is first captured group,0
Any books I should get to learn python I'm a beginner,0
@Deleted User just learn about re.sub,0
@Deleted User Many good ones can be found on the web for free and legally like Byte of Python,0
@Deleted User http://python.swaroopch.com/,0
Thanks @Doctor for your precious information with that my program is almost complete,0
,0
,0
> @Deleted User Also re.sub() replaces all matches it finds not just the first.@eager I'll investigate about it,0
@Deleted User could also use named groups```pydef apply_rule(string: str): return re.sub(r'\\(?P<content>\\w+)\\ r'<i>\\g<content></i> string.strip())```,0
Is python for dummies a good book,0
@Deleted User i could explain that regexp if you want,0
Okey @Doctor or send me a link to the documentation that I can read about it,0
I'll implement that in the code thank you again,0
@gilgamesh need something simple,0

hi guys,0
I wonder what you guys think of the recent code nomenclature changes,0
to support BLM,0
I woke up this morning realising that `master` has been to changed to `main`,0
and `blacklist` is now ... `allowList`,0
what's going to happen to the `black` formatter,0
@lackdaz Let's keep this channel on topic bringing up polarizing discussions is not the best thing here,0
good point!,0
AFAIK github still has `master` as the defualt branch,0
lets say i theoretically wanted to install every python package on a linux vm. what would i do to accomplish that,1
its main now tbh,0
I just created a repo,0
no it's `main` now,0
@CatsRCool every Python package?,0
well anything available on pipi'm just curious im not using it for any coding related projects or whatever,0
Well don't do that 🙂,0
@gilgamesh is python for dummies not worth reading then,0
> Well don't do that 🙂@Doctor theoretically if i wanted to,0
Theoretically all you'll get is pain,0
@CatsRCool There are 264823 packages... that would take up a lot of space. And that's impossible: packages can have conficting _module_ names. For example `lark` and `larkparser` both export a module called `lark`.,1
still.lets say it was all possible,0
@CatsRCool This SO answer links an endpoint you can apparently use to query package names from pypi: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23860244,0
thanks!,0
But yeah installing them all simultaneously will not work.,0

Hello,0
Python uses banker's rounding,0
docs are loading a bit slow for me,0
@lef I don't personally know but you should ask in #communitymeta instead.,0
Also some rounding differences is due to floating point limitations,0
> if two multiples are equally close rounding is done toward the even choice (so for example both round(0.5) and round(0.5) are 0 and round(1.5) is 2),1
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round>,0
why not just implement round like people think it would work?,0

@carloslvm nah everything is written in js,0
Javascript is mainly used for clientside scripting in webdev. You can also use it as a backend language. It's not widely used outside of webdev.,1
you can use node.js for desktop stuff but node.js is very different from actual js,0
at bottom everything is assembly sure but there's a lot of other choices to have based on your use case,0
wait really?,0
Well you can make desktop apps with Electron using JS Discord and VS Code are made with Electron for instance. And... my laptop doesn't appreciate their performance requirements 👀,1

@skink hashdigest returns a string. but why are you hashing the result of a hash?,0
you need a `.encode()` after the hexdigest,0
@carloslvm It's been intentionally left out.,0
@carloslvm lots of people don't like that book,0
also why the repr?,0
@skink hmm i guess i don't know what you are doing here. what is the hash for?,0
i would think you need to canonicalize the dict or the hash might not be useful,0
you need to make sure that equal dicts create equal hashes,0
@skink do you know what I mean about canonicalizing the dict?,0
@skink You want `{'a':1 b':2}` and `{'b':2 a':1}` to hash the same I think right?,0
@skink those two dicts will have different repr's so they will hash differently the way you are doing it.,0
is a hash map just a dictonary?,0
xd,0
the idea is the same though,0
ok,0
thanks xd,0
no unfortunatly,0
only python and a little c++,0
ok,0
why is it called a hashmap and not just a dictonary?,0
ah ok,0
you should be asking the opposite question,0
why is a hashmap called a dictionary in Python,0
yep it's very fast,0
"so instead of {""foo"": bar""} its {hash(""foo""): bar""}?",0
@Zilcher no need. dicts uses hashes also,0
how does that make it more efficient?,0
@Deleted User no,0
in selenium is there a way to catch the errors? like `selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: no such element: Unable to locate element:`,0

in selenium is there a way to catch the errors? like `selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: no such element: Unable to locate element:`,0
oh i confused it with something else,0
nice popcorn though,0
is there a way that I can print the hashmap instead of the string representation?,0
@skink this is the same isn't it? repr() doesn't canonicalize the dict,0
@Deleted User what does print the hashmap mean? `{'a':1}` is a dict,0
ok,0
"so I\'m looking at what zilcher said earlier just do hash(key) lol""is that what python internally thinks it is?",0
oh ok,0
@skink maybe ask your prof about it,0
> Return the hash value of the object (if it has one). Hash values are integers. They are used to quickly compare dictionary keys during a dictionary lookup. Numeric values that compare equal have the same hash value (even if they are of different types as is the case for 1 and 1.0).in the python 3 docs for hash() how does using an integer make it faster?,1
oh so it already has to convert it to an integer for the computer?,0
that just skips a step that the interpeter would have to do itself?,0
ok,0
internally `d[k]` uses the hash of k,0
yes 🙂,0
```py>>> var = {'a': 1}>>> var['a'] == hash(var['a'])True>>> ``` is that why this works?,0
because it's a reference to the same object,0
no,0
the value isn't hashed. the key is hashed.,0

yes,0
it makes the components a list,0
it basically says its a list,0
"Try this:```pysci_fi = Star Wars Men in Black Ready Player One""print(f""You might like {sci_fi}"")```",0
@kutiekatj9 the problem is he needs a list along with formatting,0
@CatsRCool He's still going to hit the same issue if he changes it to a list. Str concatenation won't work with lists either.,1
@kutiekatj9 yes but its still better for him to make it a list,0
thats a very ugly tuple,0
Why? Does it need to be mutable?,0
yes,0
in his case im pretty sure it does,0

Hi sirs has anyone used Python to create png images before?,0
I want to create a program that automates the creation of text images,0
Basically I need to select font placement resolution of image and set background as transparent with python and output .png images,1
@SparkyDoc2k7 I think that just creates graphics drawn to the screen which may be what I have to use but I think it wasnt really designed for what I'm looking for but will investigate,1
Thanks though 🙂,0
@SparkyDoc2k7 hmm maybe it can do what Im looking for does anybody know much about Pillow library?,0
Hey..so the modules i use in my kivy project is not found when packaged and run on android,0
@Urkchar Already asked what specifically is capable of solving my problem above tho so :ok_shrug:,0
Looks like it can draw text `ImageDraw.text(xy text fill=None font=None anchor=None spacing=4 align='left direction=None features=None language=None stroke_width=0 stroke_fill=None)`,0
Anyone who uses kivy,0
When i package it to android apk and install..some of the module are not found,0
@Urkchar not to draw out a conflict but I did,0
It changes the list,0

does anyone know how to convert 189s to minutes? with math,0
yes but 60 is over 100 not 60,0
so it wont work,0
you want the result in minutes and seconds?,0
yes,0
```py>>> mins secs = divmod(189 60)>>> mins3>>> secs9```,0
there you go,0
how u do that?,0
which is basically (but more efficient than) `mins = 189 // 60` and `secs = 189 % 60`,0
okay so think about it this way,0
ohh i dont need to import anything?,0
nope,0
wow,0
to find the number of minutes in a number of seconds you want to divide by 60 and ignore the fractional part,1
that's `//`,0
to find the number of seconds remaining you want the remainder of division by 60,0
that's `%`,0
ok now i get it,0
you can combine the two with `divmod`,0

HELP ME,0
"freeze window help me please gui,pyqt5,while,loop #helplollipop i need help",0
@Deleted User My question was actually about implementation  I had it in my head that the order in which you computed some A @ B @ C changed the complexity and I was wondering if that was implemented but some quick napkin math showed me that it actually doesnt matter (or doesnt seem to),1
like (A@B) @ C vs A@(B@C),0
```pyprint('guess the number!')no=input()k=3while no != 9':print('incorrect! try again!')k =1no=input()else:print('correct! you have magical powers!')```,0
i believe this would be the code.,0
pls fix the indentations,0
@Hixan that actually holds true,0
they are all messed up cuz i wrote it here,0
i fixed it check that out too,0
the number of tries allowed,0
it wont,0
There is a difference in the time complexity. It depends on the order of multiplication,0
its just a variable containing the number of maximum tries,0
1 min let me check,0
so is it optimised by numpy when you use the @ operator?,0
search for matrix chain multiplication problem you will understand it more,0
thank you,0
that problem describes the least number of operations you need to perform to to A@B@C@D...,0
`np.reduce or np.sum`,0
yes,0
k i fixed it but this now its not working,0
```pyprint('guess the number!')no=input()k=3while k>0 and no != 9': print('incorrect! try again!') k =1 no=input()else:print('correct! you have magical powers!')```,0
so I suppose this is more of a software bestpractises type question but why doesnt numpy use some sort of abstract representation to evaluate the expression after it is required to be calculated (without an @ operation or maybe there are even more gains to efficiency you could make with this knowledge) which would allow numpy to always minimize the complexity? or maybe there is already a wrapper to array that does this?,1
```pythondef compareTriplets(a b): print(a[0])if __name__ == __main__': fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'] w') a = list(map(int input().rstrip().split())) b = list(map(int input().rstrip().split())) result = compareTriplets(a b) fptr.write( .join(map(str result))) fptr.write('\') fptr.close()```,1

@HAPE | Typex VScode is better than Thonny. bit harder but lots more flexable.,0
@HAPE | Typex yes. good.,0
@HAPE | Typex VScode is probably the better option if you plan to use lots of python and expand your skillset,1
Thonny is casual,0
we are not casuals here,0
@HAPE | Typex VScode is good for all skill levels. thonny is for beginers ONLY,0
you dont want to switch code editers later on,0
@HAPE | Typex just download VScode UNLESS you only plan to use python for a week and move on,0
@HAPE | Typex you can but you just need to RELEARN EVERYTHING,0
@HAPE | Typex ok then use VScode and try and learn that,0
@HAPE | Typex Where the buttons are what commands to run that sorta stuff. the actual code works fine,0

"@HAPE | Typex VScode is not the hard way""its more the Easy way but with a deep end",0

@Youshisu yes he does.,0
@Youshisu sure but it is so much easyer to use it in a editor,0
@HAPE | Typex pycharm is the deepend,0
@HAPE | Typex Ok. let me expain1. python is the programming langudge. it is the same no matter what editor you use.2. editers interface with python. they try and make your coding life easyer. Thonny is the shallow kiddy pool. VScode is the pool with a shallow end and a deep end for diving. for everyone. pycharm is the open ocean.,1

having problems with installing pyaudio any help?,0
,0
ill try the new version of pip,0
@N̶͂́o̶̤̽a̵̓̀h̴̒̿ One sec.,0
@N̶͂́o̶̤̽a̵̓̀h̴̒̿ PyAudio needs to have binaries installed from a third party. https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudioBe sure to install the version that fits your edition of Python and its bitness. E.g. for 64bit Python 3.8 PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whlyou'd use `pip install` and pass the path to that file as the first argument.,1
so you need to provide the full path to the `.whl` file. If it's not in that directory where you're launching `pip` from `pip` won't find it,1
(I have it saved as a sticky),0
(I'm also assembling similar ones for PyInstaller),0
@Soutrik this might help https://pypi.org/project/PyLaTeX/,0
can someone help me with something please?,0
@Deleted User we could if you told us what it was?,0
I have a guitar and I need my pc to be able to tell what note is being played recognizing the tone. Is it possible to do it in python also is it possible with pyaudio? Being able of doing it in pyaudio would be very helpful.,1
so im in cmd trying to do a command and i typed in pip install r requirement.txt and it saysCould not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: \'requirement.txtdo you know what i could do?,1
@Deleted User I assume so although I haven't used PyAudio myself  might be worth opening a help channel to see if someone with experience with the library can help,1
k,0
Is there any difference between `all(a > 0)` and `not any(a < 0)`?,0
@Deleted User 1) is it `requirements.txt` ? (note the `s`)2) are you in the same directory as the `requirements.txt` file?3) is there in fact a `requirements.txt` file?,1
theres a requirements file but idk how to get in the same directory as the file,0
how,0
one easy way to do this is to open File Explorer for that directory then type `cmd` in the address bar and press Enter. That'll open a command line in that directory,1
oh ok,0
hmmm im going to try,0
in the long run though do learn about navigating through directories with the command line  you end up doing a lot of that when learning programming,1
ok,0
@Howl don't move `pip`.,0
pip,0
@Howl either add that directory to your PATH or use `py m pip` as a shortcut,0
it still says {Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: requirement.txt_P,0
@Deleted User again: are you misspelling the name of the file? does it actually exist?,0
oh ok,0
the files name is requirements,0
you're saying `requirement.txt`. you're leaving out the `s`.,0
ill try putting the s in it,0
It can't find a file when you don't provide the exact name for it.,0
yayyy i got it,0
i actually got it i thinnk,0
alright stupid question. I just installed pyaudio via pip install on cmd but how can i get pyaudio to my pycharm project,1
thanks @Infinimata and @Qwerty,0

How to delete an object from memory ?,0
@Kronos Objects are automatically removed from memory when they go out of scope so most of the time you don't need to do this manually,1
go out of scope meaning all references to it are gone,0
What if i wan't to do it manually,0
then you'd use `del` but again there are very few legitimate reasons to do this. What's your use case?,0
Hmm,0
^,0
Yea .. i tried that,0
again what are you trying to accomplish?,0
Just testing some pythoninternal stuff,0
@hmmm But not any returns True when none of the values are true then too right? Is there any functional difference between the two?,1
@Kronos Python keeps a running tally of how many other objects have a reference to a given object. When that count reaches zero the object is removed from memory. So if you have some big object say in a list somewhere it'll persist as long as it remains in that list.,1
Mhmm.. Thanks..,0
@Zenyxx `any` is like `or` multiple times and `all` is like `and` multiple times,0

@cyberninja console based means the app runs in the console the command line. windows based\ means the app runs in its own window,1
@fix error I meant is there any functional difference between something like `all(a > 0)` and `not any(a < 0)`?,0
@cyberninja you'd need Python installed to write any Python apps.,0
@Zenyxx `all(iterable) == not any(not x for x in iterable)`It's the De Morgan's law: `not (a and b) == (not a) or (not b)` and `not (a or b) == (not a) and (not b)`,1
@cyberninja well you need Python to do that anyway.... I'm not really sure what your question is?,0
@cyberninja you'd use something like PyInstaller to package the app to run independently.,0
@Zenyxx In your specific example there is  `a > 0` is not the opposite of `a < 0`,0
Pylance (VSCode) Keeps importing unnecessary modules while i code . anyone else facing this ?,0
@Kronos It's the autoimport thingy. I think you can disable it in the settings.,0

I've written games with Python and we have a whole channel #gamedevelopment devoted to it,0
it can be used for that hence pyglet and pygame,0

@BoB worth asking in #datascienceandai,0
@🦋『Ŏ̷̕b̵͊̀i̸͐͝t̴́̆o̵̊͆』🦋 click on the link you just posted.,0
@ATK you typically do such things with loops yes.,0
@Mimo ask in #discordbots but on the whole you're best starting with Python generally as some advanced knowledge is required,0
"How do I loop over the keys of a dict?```pydict = {""key1"":""value1 key2"":""value2""}for i in dict: print(i)# should output key1 and key2```Is this correct code?",1
thanks,0
Is there a better way of doing it or is this the best programming practice?,0
Oof,0
@Zenyxx Right `<=` is the opposite of `>`. For example `a < b` means `not (a >= b)` not `a > b` (the difference is for when`a == b`).,1
hello help me,0
@fix error That makes sense. Thanks.,0

@the great memeboi you can loop over the values,0
hey is it possible to use python to cycle through files chronologically and let one command do work on each one?,1
for instance a list is iterable because you can loop over its values,0
seems like this kind of thing is not possible with standalone bash so i might need to combine stuff,0
same with range,0
Range returns a list,0
So it's basically iterating over a list,0
@Deleted User should be possible with bash,0
well i havent be been able to find anything but even then i will need python later on anyways so i prolly wanna find out how to do it here too,1

@TwisSGC wdym,0

Input second name,0
Make another line just change first to last,0
So basic,0
and i dont think you're supposed to put a space,0
after the prompt,0
It's better,0
Hey @kendalk08!,0
Will make it more legit,0
yo boys how can i make vs code look like some old ass editor like idk i just want that old 90s feel XD dont ask why,1
oh mb,0
thats rly simple for an assignment,0
hi where can someone get one proxy just to test out what it looks like when one works?,0
is it supposed to say safari cant open the page?,0
Too many questions,0
Dang,0
help channels are going unemployed damn,0
Dude help channels exist it may help y'all more,0
Better than posting in general,0
Ye,0
Ig there can be an elif too,0
Looks more appealing,0
Scrolling too much causes wrist pain so write less lines,0
> I LOVE PYTHON!!!!@Glowstik_ > anyone know any nsfw servers@Glowstik_ How did it go from that to that,0
:incoming_envelope: :ok_hand: applied warning to @Glowstik_.,0
Wot,0
Tf did he do,0
I missed it,0
Kinda,0
@lemon one thing i wanted to tell u,0
Ppl are just posting all of their questions in here while it's soppused to be in the help channels is not it?,1
So it may can be more organized or sum,0
is there any sort of font like c64 pro which doesnt have a large width?,0
90s look lol,0
dw you'll get a lot more,0
Lol,0
Yo i have pycharm community edition but when i open it discord doesn't detect it and does not show it as a status i am asking bcz most of y'all use it,1
huh?,0
use pyinstaller,0
a module,0
oh fstrings. It's a feature in python. the `f` before the apostrophe/quotes tells python to treat the string in a certain way and will parse anything between `{}` in a particular way.,1
uh sry idk then,0
You can't. You need a mac to make mac apps,0
You can try getting a MacOS in a VM but goooood luck,0
fstring,0
> Settings > game activity change pycharm to something else. Or use discord rich presence thingy.@Zilcher tho how do i get the rich presence installed it's too complicated on their website,1
> @Zilcher tho how do i get the rich presence installed it's too complicated on their websiteu there?,0
Alr u could have said that from the beginning lol@Zilcher,0
U didn't?,0
Idk,0
Mb didn't see it,0
the gmail api si pretty cool,0
i.. the gmail api,0
ahah,0
oh,0
Hello.,0
i think there's a way easer way to do gmal stuff in python other than the official API but it's no bueno,1
can someone see what's wrong here?,0
```pythonif d['data'][0]['id'] == playlistPath': playlist = d['data'][0]['value'] print('http://127.0.0.1:8080/requests/status.xml?command=in_play&input={}'.format(playlist)) requests.post(b'http://127.0.0.1:8080/requests/status.xml?command=in_play&input=C:\\Users\\DamienS\\Music\\FavMusic auth=(VLCUser VLCPass))```,0
the http request was right and i tested with my web i copied and load it and it did the action but why it didnt do it in this code?,1
No i dont,0
and that if runs i know that because the print worked but not the request.post,0
but if i run that url with my web it works,0
this is why,0
```r'http://127.0.0.1:8080/requests/status.xml?command=in_play&input=C:\\Users\\DamienS\\Music\\FavMusic'```,0
like that?,0
!code @hsbnani,0
,0
😠 😠 😠,0
@Jac_k is that right?,0
yea,0
@Jac_k this is what i truly want ```pythonr'http://127.0.0.1:8080/requests/status.xml?command=in_play&input={}'.format(playlist)```,0
does that work?,0
ok,0
hmm it still does not work,0
Yes,0
it printed but no the request,0
to play all the mp3s in a folder and the request is from VLC,0
i wanted to remote control VLC via http request other action worked but not that line,0
http://127.0.0.1:8080/requests/status.xml?command=in_play&input=C:\\Users\\DamienS\\Music\\FavMusic,0
that's the print i got it out,0
wdym,0
yes,0
```pythonprint(requests.status(r'http://127.0.0.1:8080/requests/status.xml?command=in_play&input={}'.format(playlist) auth=(VLCUser VLCPass)))```,0
like that?,0
ohhh,0
AttributeError: module requests has no attribute status,0
hmm,0
```pythonif d['data'][0]['id'] == playlistPath': playlist = d['data'][0]['value'] response = requests.status(r'http://127.0.0.1:8080/requests/status.xml?command=in_play&input={}'.format(playlist) auth=(VLCUser VLCPass)) print(response.status)```,0
so i just add the line print(response.status)?,0
so this ```pythonresponse = requests.status(r'http://127.0.0.1:8080/requests/status.xml?command=in_play&input={}'.format(playlist) auth=(VLCUser VLCPass)) print(response.status)```,0
i beat the system,0
"```pythonclass p: def __init__(self,printe): print(printe)p(""lol"")p(""lmao"")```",0
AttributeError: Response object has no attribute status,0
so replace status with status_code right?,0
401,0
ok let me check thaty,0
wow u were right it was wrong....,0
Yay it's working thank u so much!,0
lol,0
don't tag people for no reason...,0
@919soyuz there's a much easier way to do what you want,0
@919soyuz grab a help channel and ping me and I'll show you,0
what does this mean?```pythonIndexError: list index out of range```,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx you used an index that was too large,0
what is index?,0
`L[n]` n is the index,0
ohh,0
> awwww there are no help channels availabe@919soyuz #helpdonut #helpcake,0
```pythonif d['data'][0]['id'] == playlistPath': playlist = d['data'][0]['value'] requests.post(r'http://127.0.0.1:8080/requests/status.xml?command=in_play&input={}'.format(playlist) auth=(VLCUser VLCPass))```so i can't do this?,0
"> ```python> class p:> def __init__(self,printe):> print(printe)> > p(""lol"")> p(""lmao"")```@YugoORush or you could do this lol```pydef p(text): print(text)print(\'bruh\')```",0
yes so 0 = first item then 1 = 2nd item,0
i did,0
ok i know why because data is = to [] which is nothing but sometimes i get data back with ['test ],1
and things how do i fix that issues?,0
because sometimes i get data that is [] and sometimes i get data with ['test YES!'],0
what does the data you're pulling from look like,0
"{\'data\': [] \'pluginId\': \'PluginVLC\ \'actionId\': \'Toggle\ \'type\': \'action\'}b\'{""data"":[],""pluginId"":""PluginVLC"",""actionId"":""Toggle"",""type"":""action""}\\r\\",0
that,0
but sometimes i also get this data{'data': [{'id': playlistPath value': C:\\\\Users\\\\DamienS\\\\Music\\\\FavMusic'}] pluginId': PluginVLC actionId': PlayPlaylist type': action'},0
so any idea what can i do to support both?,0
you need to check the length first i guess,0
hmm,0
oh i got idea,0
> can someone help me with something real quick@Brilew don't ask to ask just ask 🙂,0
in a function definition  gathers the positional args: `def f(args)`,0
in a function call it uses a list as the arguments: `x = f(args)`,0
(list tuple any sequence),0
yes,0
your smart nedbat the len works i just needed to make it so if len(d['data']) != 0:,0
well yes but that's only one argumeent not three,0
it sounds like you might.,0
wouldn't it just be three if statements?,0
@nedbat that is not u in pfp is it,0
@RollingRocky360 no,0
`divmod((1 2))` is an error,0
why not just 5 if statements?,0
that would work (try it!),0
Ok?,0
that is insane. without even reading it i can tell that should have been written diffrently,0
Yep. It looks like a lot of the code has been repeated,0
it does,0
> @nedbat that is not u in pfp is it,0
it is me,0
Oh,0
why wouldn't it be?,0
thought it would be,0
U think?,0
About what?,0
@RollingRocky360 it does work as both,0
@RollingRocky360 play around with it,0
> @Krachkiste There's nothing in the rules saying you can't reuse them.@MrAwesomeRocks there is no need for the question lol,0
Quick question does anyone know what it’s called to turn my program to look like that,0
Dude..,0
@Krachkiste If you want to be sure DMing @Python Discord ModMail is probably your best bet,0
Oh pycharm idk why discord does not detect it i have the community edition,0
It gets detected for others,0
@Deleted User how would discord detect your pycharm version?,0
What i mean is detecting it as a game activity you find that thing in the settings,0
Mb called status,0
No one could figure it out tho,0
.lower(),0
> yo how do u make a users answer lowercase ???@ENVY₊₊.lower method,0
@kaia <3 hi,0
What plugin,0
Dude its just pycharm,0
install an extension,0
for discord rich prescence,0
^,0
yo do,0
Hmm,0
xd,0
i hate pycharm,0
i love vscode,0
I searched it up and its complicated on thier page,0
why?,0
> why?@Deleted User how to use the rich presence tho,0
Sounds like u know,0
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10233discordintegration,0
you just need to install the plugin @Deleted User,0
then it should work,0
god damn it fuck slowmode,0
Ye igy did not notice this website while searching fucking google,0
wow relax,0
,0
We do be chillin yo,0
what?,0
i didn't snap at yall,0
@919soyuz it means i am the maintainer of a project named coverage.py,0
ah ok,0
@nedbat what does coverage.py do?,0
If yall think pycharm is shit what could be way better,0
vscode,0
pycharm isn't shit,0
i just dislike it,0
> notepad@JimBo very,0
it's super slow on lower end computers,0
Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. It monitors your program noting which parts of the code have been executed then analyzes the source to identify code that could have been executed but was not. https://coverage.readthedocs.io,1
oh nice,0
it is slow af on my lenovo. 2 minutes to start a script...,0
,0
@Soviet Spy ikr,0
it takes 5 minutes to index files,0
plus the built in terminal is weird,0
i dislike it,0
> vscode@Deleted User fr? Its way more buggy and difficult to use,0
no it isn't,0
Ah that's what that mf does. Anyways it's perfect on the school mac really enjoyable,0
i haven't had any bugs in vscode,0
Like excuting code is shit on it,0
not really,0
oh no,0
I use zsh in vscode's terminal,0
zero problems ever with anything,0
Hmm i don't think so,0
The ide wars begin yet again,0
Like,0
If there was anything else damn,0
pycharm is super slow,0
true,0
it is,0
> haha well technically vscode is not an IDE xD so war over@Fisher lmao,0
plus its written in ||java|| 0_0,0
> python makes my brain hurt i aint understand anything lmao@ae try assembly,0
lmfao,0
I have never had an issue with PyCharm being slow. It feels really smooth and well built,0
Would be ez shit on him,0
"assembly has a lot of e""s",0
pycharm is slow on my laptop,0
Oh,0
plus,0
Laptop gang,0
its interface is clunky,0
don't get me wrong,0
if you have a pc,0
Maybe you should blame the laptop and not PyCharm hahah,0
go for pycharm,0
but,0
Dude its rocket speed on pc,0
it is,0
but the problem is that I don't develop on my pc,0
Yeah. Sublime is by far the fastest,0
sublime,0
It’s insane how fast it opens,0
> Yeah. Sublime is by far the fastest@Vestergurkan no notepad.,0
sublime is good,0
the thing is,0
its 80$,0
what,0
?,0
isnt it?,0
Honestly TextEdit and Sublime are are squally fast at starting for me,0
xd,0
me with my laptop waiting 3 minutes for notepad to index a blank document:,0
> its 80$@war.saw.pakt#7237 you can use the free version without any problems,0
Wait what's the pro edition of pycharm like?,0
Haven’t tried it yet,0
Like the ce is already stuffed of features,0
im installing sublime now,0
and flask,0
What could possibly be added,0
yeah,0
Flask doesn't work with pycharm?,0
it does,0
o ok,0
of course it does,0
yeah,0
it just has extra shit for it,0
yep,0
alright,0
im gonna go actually work on my project,0
adios friends,0
Good luck,0
Ahhah,0
how,0
can sublime make .py files?,0
it doesnt for me,0
"!e ```pyprint(""pycharm > vsc"")```",0
when i do save as and choose .py it still saves as regular file,0
yes,0
ok so thats what i do normally lol,0
i also tried save as .py,0
alright,0
none worked,0
extension?,0
like i can run the files by doing python (myfile) but the file itself isnt .py,0
ohh,0
so the name has to be .py,0
> what kind of file is it?@Luca Brasi no idea tbh,0
ok ill try that thanks,0
no it dosen't @Luca Brasi,0
it can be any extension,0
what ide are you on @ae,0
das a weird ide,0
anyways shift+enter should work,0
idk what idle is tho,0
Hey guys,0
its the default editor installed with python,0
Never had that issue tho,0
Any way for me to output the current date in text in line 18(for a google form),0
yeah,0
codewars is p cool,0
teaches you how to think like a engineer,0
how to avoid using a lot of if statements?,0
python dosen't have switch,0
@919soyuz no it doesn't run it continuously,0
@kendalk08 str(dictonary),0
str(dict) should work,0
@Gamer Dog if/elif/elif/elif,0
xd,0
Can anyone help me get an output as the current date,0
for a selenium,0
so the most optimized way is to do if/elifs?,0
```pytry: passexpect: try: pass expect: pass```,0
dictionary and searching for the key?,0
@919soyuz It monitors your program noting which parts of the code have been executed then analyzes the source to identify code that could have been executed but was not.,1
@Deleted User `except:` not `expect:`,0
@Δv you could always take a break from it or try something new. Maybe try some new area or a new programming language altogether. However you can’t always find inspiration. It’s ok to have days when you’re not as inspired. Happens to all of us :),1
> @Deleted User `except:` not `expect:`@Pedro. :cry:,0
what?,0
Yeah I know the feeling as well,0
build a webscraper,0
those are fun,0
!projects here are a few projects you could check out if y out wanna have some inspiration for things to do,1
,0
or a gui with everything you need,0
No need to even choose one of the specific ones listed. As long as you find something you’d like to do even if it’s just an idea from reading the list,1
are you a begginer @Δv ?,0
beginner,0
then there should be a lot to do ig,0
Yep! Maybe you want something new. You could try out something like `git`. That’s really a skill you’ll have use of in the future. Maybe it’ll be a bit complex for now — maybe not,1
3.8.6 is the most recent one. The others are earlier versions; the newer versions have bugfixes and some different features.,0
it's better to use a while loop than to call the function again,0
@f.catus don't be like that,0
it's mean,0
@f.catus please don't post stuff like that here. use OT if you must,0
what does that mean doesn't use relative paths?,0
!resources @919soyuz have you seen the resources page yet?,0
,0
@919soyuz I'd recommend starting with one of the more general books like Byte of Python (a favorite of mine as it is very methodical and unpretentious),1
@919soyuz free as oxygen!unless you're on Mars haha,0
@919soyuz https://python.swaroopch.com/,0
@f.catus what did you mean about relative paths?,0
Hey does anyone know why fdate = date.today().strftime(\'%d/%m/%Y\') is appearing as 02/10/2020 instead of todays date?,0
> Hey does anyone know why fdate = date.today().strftime(\'%d/%m/%Y\') is appearing as 02/10/2020 instead of todays date?@Techツ that is the day month year today,1

wow i’ve just been using `datetime.datetime.now()` all this time,0
> selenium questions are prohibited in this channel@f.catus#6950 they are not,0
Many questions about scraping with selenium breach TOS because automated scrapers like that aren’t allowed but there are legitimate uses of it,1
Feel free to ask @I have 4 phd’s,0
For sure,0
@I have 4 phd’s flask django fastapi,0
There are frameworks like Django Flask and Django REST Framework for that,0
If you’re looking to create a frontend as well that isn’t very basic I’d also recommend using a frontend language like React or Vue,1
What langauge do arduinos use,0

ah sorry,0
i don't know selenium sorry,0
ask!,0
Hey @뚱이!,0
\\```py# your code\\```,0
@Wigsy json.loads() iirc,0
did you do load or loads? @Wigsy,0
@Python,0
and how do you load it @Wigsy,0
dm me your code,0
or claim a help channel,0

Hello.,0
@kendalk08 Beauty of programming. Eventually it works.,0
lol,0
right,0
> Eventually,0
hello,0
I'm currently still mastering the basics.,0
I'm on my second run through the course.,0
I believe I mastered functions/variables,0
a day,0
"```python> x = game is absolutely amazing""def myfunc(): x = game absolutely sucks"" print(""This  + x + !"")myfunc()print(""This  + x + !"")y = a very good person""def myfunc(): y = a very shitty person"" print(""He is  + y + .."")myfunc()print(""He is  + y + !"")u = he fell""def myfunc(): u = He scored"" print(""Oh my god  + u + !"")myfunc()print(""Oh my god  + u + !"")```",1
wrote that wihtout lookin gat anything,0
off my head,0
thank you.,0
yeah i wanna go into nerual neurons,0
and learn how to defend and offend in hacking,0
Developing AI,0
lol,0
yeah,0
mb,0
I'm starting to be able to write things off my head.,0
yeah,0
@f.catus books how do they work,0
i like variables and functions,0
functions are where it's at,0
"make 1,000 functions",0
Maybe I\'ll reuse this,0
@kendalk08 It's good you're getting into the habit of not shoving everything into one file.,0
`fstrings` I only started using a few days ago.,0
That makes it more nice now,0
@Zeke Yeah he is just learning,0
"```python> a = enjoy""b = programming""print(""I  + a +  a lot of  + b + .""```",0
For years I've been using `format` but with tuples n shiznit,0
unesscary functions,0
but its still fun,0
But dont use + cuz its just makes your code look messy,0
F string is much better,0
i like making it look complicated,0
Oh that make sense,0
> @Zeke easier to read and fix in my opinion. I hate reading code to fix my errors.@kendalk08 100% agreed,0
> i like making it look complicated@United NO,0
BAD LOL,0
lmaoo,0
pep8 more like poopate,0
only language i know is python and its the basics,0
@United But in the future you should keep your code clean concise and readable as much as you can,0
yea,0
rules,0
second run through,0
@alckasoc Im pretty sure yeah,0
https://gyazo.com/1017da9c8d176532912af00a815d5c82,0
trying to master all those subjects by memory,0
if I have to do it a third i will,0
When I first started learning then return and print statement just made me lost,0
Like I was really thinking about what in the world is going on in those 2,0
is it expected to remember all of the subjects by memory after a day lmao,0
and a second run through,0
TBH don't think about how they work. LOL,0
Not worth it. Just use them.,0
Ikr,0
then I just decided to not even think about how they work but just use it whenever it is needed,0
It's like you start debating yourself about it XD,0
I took a course in college that covered assembly and I have no idea what happened.,0
Im 16,0
lol,0
@Zeke XD bro tbh it be like that,0
oh,0
it really do,0
"That wasn\'t lost in translation so much I was just like why the big words"".",0
what do you mainly use when programming applications or making certain things for hacking.,0
like thebasics wise,0
I heard python is used for hacking too,0
yea to write hacks,0
But there is something else,0
i forgot the name of it,0
@𝕷𝖔𝕮𝖔 Probs because it's just quick to write.,0
yeah but I'm asking out of the basics you learn what do yo use most?,0
@Zeke Right there is something else that hackers use a lot,0
I just don't remember the name of it,0
@United functions make everything functions,0
oh,0
for reusability,0
IMO the best library to learn is `argparse`,0
ye,0
I have only used each of those once and at work not even for my own stuff. LOL,0
"f""{x} is just way easier and better",0
just use f string format,0
@kendalk08 yes,0
so lets say your looking into the grey hat section of hacking what should you get for libraries and what should you focus on?,1
newish feature,0
ish,0
where you can defend and reverse engineer if needed,0
thats at least how i look at grey hat,0
@United Hack is a broad word but I assume you\'re working with websites so uh `requests`? lol,0
Hmm... what can be some good examples of hacking in python?,0
Kinda curious about that,0
making keyloggers,0
rat's,0
LOL,0
HAX,0
"@kendalk08 Anything in `{ }` gets interpreted in a string that starts with `f` like `f""{variable}""`. I think that\'s all you need to know.",1
LOL Yup thats all you need to know,0
<https://pypi.org/project/hax/>This library is literally called `hax` Although it might not mean what you mean by hack,0
oh no,0
I hate that,0
> HAX lets you write compiled bytecode inline:hyperlemon:,0
What does that mean?,0
bytecode inline?,0
click da link,0
it hurt me tho be careful lol,0
@𝕷𝖔𝕮𝖔 before running Python is compiled into an intermediate representation called _bytecode_ which is a lowlevel very basic language.,0
!e```pyimport disdef add_numbers(a b): return a + bdis.dis(add_numbers)```,0
@fix error :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```001 | 4 0 LOAD_FAST 0 (a)002 | 2 LOAD_FAST 1 (b)003 | 4 BINARY_ADD004 | 6 RETURN_VALUE```,1
well that's an unimportant detail here,0
@fix error Gotchu,0
and `hax` lets you write the bytecode directly.,0
what is an example of a bytecode?,0
Could be some kinda of numbers translated to letters?,0
@𝕷𝖔𝕮𝖔 It is stored as a bunch of bytes but it can be pretty printed like in the snippet above ^,1
Good Morning,0
"I made this a while ago @Zeke ```pyfrom hax import @haxdef add_tuples(a b): LOAD_FAST(""a"") UNPACK_SEQUENCE(2) ROT_TWO() LOAD_FAST(""b"") UNPACK_SEQUENCE(2) ROT_THREE() BINARY_ADD() ROT_THREE() BINARY_ADD() ROT_TWO() BUILD_TUPLE(2) RETURN_VALUE()```it adds two 2element iterables elementwise (like `add_tuples((1 2) (200 100)) == (201 102)`) and it turns out to be faster than any builtin way of doing that",1
I... am impressed.,0
it took me a while 🙂,0
SUBMIT PR TO PYTHON,0
MAKE IT REQUIRE HAX,0
You can still write bytecode by hand just not as conveniently.,0
ofc,0
MARS,0
alright let's not scare people to death,0
Screw bytecode write binary.,0
Screw typing binary flip transistors manually until you make what you want.,0
@ScarScar It's probably more efficient; and there's probably no way to run it without converting it to bytecode,0
@TheWhiteShadow If you want to convert between degrees and radians you can use `math.degrees` and `math.radians` 🙂,0
quickboi,0
@salt :x: Your eval job has completed with return code 1.```001 | File <string> line 4002 | SyntaxError: illegal expression for augmented assignment```,1
Am I doing something wrong here??,0
xx boy... download PyCharm or use Repl.it,0
they are much better than that,0
@Isaiah The Greatest What do you want to do?,0
!e```pythonclass fib: def __init__(self total_fibonacci_numbers): self.a self.b = 0 1 def __iter__(self): self.c = 1 return self def __next__(self): fib = self.a while self.c <= total_fibonacci_numbers: self.a self.b self.c = self.b self.a + self.b self.c + 1 return fibten_sequence = fib(10)for fibonacci_number in ten_sequence: print(fibonacci_number)```,1
You are not allowed to use that command here. Please use the #botcommands channel instead.,0
Oh :c,0
I'm just stripping the white space from the statement,0
dude,0
I was just thinking about that,0
yeah,0
[[key value] for key value in character_counts.items()] << like this,0
> @alckasoc Thanks it worked.@Urkchar it Is the same,0
,0
```pythonclass fib: def __init__(self total_fibonacci_numbers): self.a self.b = 0 1 self.total_numbers = total_fibonacci_numbers def __iter__(self): self.c = 1 return self def __next__(self): fib = self.a while self.c <= self.total_numbers: self.a self.b self.c = self.b self.a + self.b self.c + 1 return fib raise StopIterationten_sequence = fib(10)for fibonacci_number in ten_sequence: print(fibonacci_number)```What do you think about this code? I needed to use classes no yield for now.,1
Parenthesis works too..but it will be a generator,0
Why can't i strip out individual letters?,0
@Kronos But for that kinda stuff it is always brackets,0
@Isaiah The Greatest `strip` removes characters from the beginning or the end of a string.,0
!d str.strip,0

You can use `replace` if you want to remove characters from anywhere in the string.,0
fair fair... thx,0

```pyclass Fib: def __init__(self total_fibonacci_numbers): self.total_numbers = total_fibonacci_numbers def __iter__(self): a b = 0 1  for _ in range(self.total_numbers): yield b a b = b a + b```here's a trick you can use ^ @Deleted User,1
@Misaka Network Server Official idk what are you using? but i suggest using PyCharm its the best onee,0
Yes that's using yield,0
but I could do,0
@𝕷𝖔𝕮𝖔 VS Code is just fine. It's not true that PyCharm is the objectively best editor for everyone.,0

@Yankee nope,0

@Misaka Network Server Official thats cool,0
Can I return an expression in return ?/,0

That should work I think,0
(If using yield),0
How do you get the error raised?somehting like```pytry: passexcept err as err: print(err)```,0
@Yankee Sure. If your question is Can I do X? the best way to find out is almost always to try to do X.,1
> Can I return an expression in return ?/@Yankee i think you'll have to return it as a string ?,0
cool,0
@Deleted User You don't need to `raise StopIteration` in a generator (that will actually result in a different exception  you're not supposed to do that).,1
> cool@Yankee i think therr might a way around what you are doing.. you can also pass around functions,0
You can return a lambda or smtg,0

Yes.. Welcome to recursion,0
> What are some of the situation when we would make our own iterator ?@Kronos Well you rarely need your own iterator type. But generators can be useful.One use case is when you need to lazily process some data and store some state in the meanwhileYou can also use a generator to paginate an algorithm so that it makes progress in discrete steps i.e. you can pause or resume it at any point```pydef find_sum(numbers): accumulator = 0 for i n in enumerate(numbers): accumulator += n if i % 4 == 0: yield None yield accumulator```,1
@kendalk08 If you want an infinite loop you can use a `while` loop.,0

last question what is the load() function which module ?,0
> last question what is the load() function which module ?@Yankee well,0
a lot of modules have a `load` function,0
what do you want to load?,0
pickle ?,0
is that right ?,0
`pickle` is for loading well pickle files,0
but there's also `json.load` to load JSONs etc.,0
which is why I asked what you want to load,0
It's both load right ?,0
not loads,0
yh,0
> not loads@Yankee they both exist,0
and pickle unpacks binary file,0
`load` is for file objects and `loads` is for strings,0
K the json uses loads right ?,0
> what is json?@vinam a way to store certain objects as text,0
no it's a file format,0
is `@dataclass` a build in decorator?,0
> just use sql@vinam different use cases.,0

> hmm ngl but i like sql@vinam they're two different things.,0
for example let's say you want to send something over the internet,0
you could send it in JSON format.,0
ohhh what does `@dataclass` do ?,0
yes,0
json is very easy,0
not much stuff at all only lists and dict,0
Json looks neat and presentable,0
"```py>>> from json import dumps>>> data = [{\'id\': 1 \'value\': 36} {\'id\': 2 \'value\': None}]>>> dumps(data)\'[{""id"": 1 value"": 36} {""id"": 2 value"": null}]\'```",1

this one,0
you shouldn't be using `exec`/`eval` until you know when you need to,0
Oh for my bot,0
I want to learn penetration testing but I need to finish learning the rest of Python before I go on to HTTP.,1

I need to learn more advanced Python.,0
Can anyone help me with this ?Define methods Add_Product(Product) and Delete_Product (Product) in Python to add and delete a Product from a queue implemented using List. The List Product stores the details [P_No P_Name Cost] of various products.,1

@Krzysztof use `<>` around links,0
thx,0
> this one@Isaiah The Greatest I think it's because you are returning the value you just have to print it,0
> but I think the image adds to it@Krzysztof takes up unnccesasary screen space,0
How do i get a return from exec?,0
@Inheritance ♦ okay example:```py>>> class X:... def __init__(self value):... self._value = value... @property... def value(self):... print('value was gotten')... return self._value... @value.setter... def value(self new_value):... print(f'value was set to {new_value}')... self._value = new_value...>>> x = X(1)>>> x.valuevalue was gotten1>>> x.value = 2value was set to 2>>> x.valuevalue was gotten2```,1
"```pyasync def evaluate(self ctx  toeval): if with open in toeval.lower(): await ctx.send(""Cannot evaluate this"") return if ``\\`py in toeval: toeval.strip(""`\\``py"") toeval.strip(""`\\``"") await ctx.send(""Evaluating your code"") try: result = exec(toeval) except Exception as err: result = err await ctx.send(f""``\\`py\{toeval}``"") await ctx.send(result)```This is my code rn",1
so basically properties let you run extra code when you read or set what looks like an instance attribute.,0
Eval doesn't work it raises that errorexec works but doesn't give a return,0
ohhhhhh ok,0

that methods that modify their instance return `None`,0
```py>>> a = []>>> print(a.append(1))None```,0
oh,0
ok thx,0
@Inheritance ♦ it's a function annotation```pydef f(x: int) > str: return str(x)```^ this means that `f` accepts an `int` and returns a `str`. It's just documentation doesn't change anything at runtime.It can also be picked up by static analysis tools like `mypy` and `pyright`.<https://realpython.com/pythontypechecking/>,1
because `.append` modifies the `list`,0
so it returns `None` by convention,0
And if a `return` isn't executed inside a function `None` is returned.,0

it does,0
but only whats been written in the document it doesnt have autocomplete like vscode does (including plugins ofc),0
what are those things in sublime that suggest things though?,0
linter?,0
no lol,0
its just suggestions based on whats been written in ur document,0
so if u wrote `dsadgasyusa` in the document before it'll suggest that,0
that seems like it would be a dark pattern given I fucking suck at coding.,0
like here for example all of these have been written in the document before,0
so it suggests those (theyre not variables or any of that tho lol just random words sublime thinks would be useful to u),1
is it based on what you write or the documents you have opened?,0
based on what you write,0
i told u how it works lol,0
do i need to explain again :lol:,0
so i couldn't open a bunch of properly written documents and teach it to suggest nonstupid shit.,0
yeah,0
^,0
as i said if uve written `sdadsads` it'll suggest that its a word sublime thinks will be useful for u or smth lol,1
sudo dad's ads?,0
> @Deleted User are these suggestions availabe in vscode?@PrettyTechnical yes and theres plugins for autocomplete for different languages so i would recommend vscode over any other text editor if u want full autocomplete,1
@PrettyTechnical u dont have the `python` env variable set,0
@Skynse those are instances from what i know,0
yep they are,0
so 1 might not be cmd,0

wot?,0
im talking about env variable on windows,0
yea and its not related to vscode,0
he doesnt need a virtual env if he only has to add an env variable,0

@Uoino fstring inception,0
If u use fstrings it wouldn't be needed,0
Wait I'll show my example,0
,0
"F""hello{f""hello""}",0
So I can make a movie called stringception,0
Or just define something to a fstring then put it in the fstring,0
No we need more fstrings inside fstrings,0
I want 20 of them,0
Ya like that,0
No I'm just curious on how far you could take it,0

> Hey everyone! Sorry to interrupt here but I am writing a new program for dnd and need Ideas! This program is basically going to be a combat buddy. The idea is you'd plug in your characters data (stats abilities etc) and the program will give you a list of moves you can make in each round of combat. The program would update round by round it would keep track of the spell slots used spell duration concentrations  effects on your character (paralyzed frightened etc). Does that kinda make sense? I'm not sure I'm explaining it very well but in any case I need more ideas to add! So if you play dnd my question is this: what do you think is the hardest thing to keep track of during combat? Is there anything else I should add to this program? As for the programming side of things: this is going to be a big project for me with TONS of data any ideas on how I can make it seem more manageable? I am pretty new to coding I have never been good at managing my data that's part of why I choose to make this project so I can improve in that area. I'd love to hear any and all thoughts if anyone has anything!@nikki.hayessss well i dont know about hardest thing to keep track of but i can challenge you by asking to include misses critical hits and shocks,1

what is machine learning?,0
what? how to python?,0
i dont want a bite,0
what is that you can't do with sublime that you aim to solve with vscode?,0
so am I,0
eh?,0
VS Code is more of a general editor; it has addons for many languages and many other things apart from programming,1
if that's not your jam or your jelly for that matter by all means use PyCharm,0
sublime text is also general,0
pycharm is kinda confusing for me,0

I understand that I just wanted to know their reason for switching. I assume it must be a particular problem. I wanted to know so if I ever run into such a thing I can keep a note,1
yes but in what sense are you asking that? good as in using it or the tools you can have with it?,1
does my question sound like I'm pointing out a mistake? I am just trying to understand that's all. If you don't want to answer that's fine.,1
there's just too many text editors I wanted to know your rationale,0
is there a way to make and entire list and dict empty?,0
Herroooo,0
who needs help?,0
I do,0
@Inheritance ♦ yes,0
You can just set the name of the variable to an empty list: `list_var = []`,0

Hello quick question is Peer to Peer just socket programming behind the scenes?,0
@Deleted User I didn\'t know you can add pycharm as the currently playing game,0
Hi I am a post grad researching Artificial Intelligence I have to use Python a lot at the moment I hear Pycharm is the best IDE but I dislike its bulkiness and slowness sometimes is wing a good alternative which also have the windows command line built into it? Is it fast?,1
@Deleted User Sublime text or VS Code,0
sublime text is super fast and simple,0
VS Code is good if you need to interact with the code,0
VS Code also has support for Jupyter notebooks now,0
@Deleted User if you're willing to go the length i'd say Vim with a plugin to work with language server.,0
@marc giving him all the options.... he may prefer text editor since he dislikes the bulkiness of the IDE he used,1
@Higgs have you used JupyterLab?,0
it's like jupyterlab but with more features,0
it's part of the jupyter project,0
I meant to say like jupyter notebooks lol,0
see: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/,0
@Higgs I use them when I'm handling large data sets so that I don't have to call the dataset every time. It's also very useful for plotting data,1
guys I mentioned IDE's not text editors,0
Is VS Code the best for 4GB ram i5?,0
please rephrase answers to suit,0
@Deleted User IDE ===> use VS Code,0
I don't use microsoft software,0
is like giving my computer cancer,0
(no offence to those who suffer with cancer),0
@Deleted User this one is open source so it's really unlike any other microsoft products. But if you hate microsoft a lot then use Atom,1
there's also a demicrosofted version of VS Code,0
@Infinimata really? what's the project name?,0
https://vscodium.com/,0
ooooh fantastic,0
I wonder if all the updates are in sync with the mother project,0
@Daniel1120 use `return`,0
machine learning suxxx,0
it's VS Code without the MS telemetry basically.,0
@Infinimata is it batched and uptodate?,0
I mean they literally explain on the page what the project is and why it exists you could read that,0
yah...,0
yeah it seems to be kept closely in sync with the main project,0
well thanks a lot I didn't know about it @Infinimata,0
@kendalk08 what do you need help with?,0
guys can we focus on original question,0
@Deleted User we answered you,0
I said IDE not text editor I was looking for comparison between pycharm and wings not other suggestions,0
if no one has used both thats fair,0
@Deleted User you didn't mention wings in your original question,0
most IDEs at this point are text editors with plugins to add functionality.,0
I haven't used Wings myself don't know much about it,0
@kendalk08 let me see the code I might be able to help you,0
@Infinimata just curious is this from Hikaru no Go?,0
oh nvm I don't think so,0
@felis catus ha! Onmyoji actually. I like the look of the character it's nifty,0

guys how do i make my python http server decode url encoded characters in the url?,0
@felis catus yup the character does resemble Sai somewhat,0
ok so I want to connect to a proxy using a user name and password in a format like this @Infinimata <SomeIp>:Username:Password,1

what's really amazing about Python is that it can be run on loads of other things like a phone for example and you can run really complex stuff on a phone! For example a Discord.py bot!,1
yes,0
,0
do codewars too,0
@Deleted User is it on resources,0
@claudiaagrzz oh I don't know spanish,0
> @Deleted User is it on resources@Deleted User idk,0
its a book,0
what are some good python IDEs for android?,0
@Deleted User whats it called again ima go to the library on Tuesday,0
On Android you can just get Termux and install Python on there and slap some \\.py files on there and it works just fine.,1
> what's really amazing about Python is that it can be run on loads of other things like a phone for example and you can run really complex stuff on a phone! For example a Discord.py bot!@atlas_core this is true to a extent BUT python is also limited in how far you can take it in multiple areas,1
@Deleted User Yeah true,0
@claudiaagrzz ight,0
"Why are there so many users whose name here is !""?",0
> @Deleted User whats it called again ima go to the library on Tuesday@Deleted User https://www.amazon.com/PythonCrashCourse2ndEdition/dp/1593279280,0
they think its cool cus they get the top of member list,0
i cant talk my name is event,0
@Kanza how many pings do you get a day,0
i have accidently pinged you like 100 times,0
> @Invictus I really wouldn't recommend using your phone to program@jet Not to program but to test small bits of codes or trying and testing and brainstorming small code blocks,1
Can anyone give a list of books I should get to learn ima go to the library and get em all,1
Or at least 35,0
> @atlas_core it makes their name go to the top of the list@dsnk But why?,0
dont use books for python imo,0
Why,0
because the language is extremely simple you dont require a book,0
i understand that but your better off going on docs,0
rather than books,0
buh,0
@Deleted User how did you go about learning it,0
buh.. like.. why?,0
@Deleted User i learned python through random docs i found online,0
@claudiaagrzz I watched that guy,0
> @Deleted User thats a difficult and innefective way of learning the language and programming in general@jet not for some.,0
But everything goes in one ear and out the other,0
it comes down to how you learn,0
i dont find reading theory good for learning at all.,0
books talk about much more than string manipulation,0
"> random docs i found onlineThere\'s only one place to find python docs. Maybe you mean something different by docs""?",0
Well python documentation has a decent tutorial but it's probably more for people who already know 1 or 2 programming languages.,1
i would still be confused on basic snytax if i was to read it from a book but that mainly just comes down to me being weird,1
I like how people aren't some creeps on this server other servers I gotta turn DM's off and make sure it's always off because there are loads of creeps,1
its just something i dont personally find useful. not bashing you or others,0
Seriously just try Think Python 2e by Downey,0
perfect for beginners,0
no it teacher 3> @Invictus I think it might teach you python 2 tho@jet,0
teaches,0
1e was for python 2,0
i learn different from others @jet i also am on the spectrum if that has anything to do with it.,0
although i doubt it does,0
I am a freshman student,0
i learn literally everything i do through bruteforce spamming stuff,0
I had like a very little knowledge of python,0
I wish I did computer science in college,0
Really wish I did,0
So I'm taking the Data Programming I course,0
Regret not picking it,0
bachelors in computer science hardware architecture is what i am starting soon,0
if i get accepted lol,0
and we're using Think python 2e and Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart,0
I'm in UK so college is different here than in the states,0
Start with Think Python 2 e though,0
I'm also learning java lol,0
so python is like a piece of cake,0
i have messed with java never written anything in it,0
I go through the python material after I've gone through and am comfortable with the java material,0
I wish the library was open tomorrow,0
> I wish the library was open tomorrow@Deleted User Get eBooks my man,0
well @Deleted User my dms are always open if you need help,0
K,0
what i would suggest is thinking of something you want to make,0
then trying to make it,0
Yh,0
I kinda wanna make a game like colour switch,0
Simple one,0
Nothing to extreme,0
Any suggestion on a Python book? Some programming experience,0
i can recommend books just not programming ones 😅,0
assembly gang where you at,0
its scary someone replied ot that,0
they teach you theory behind assembly not the language itself (IN MOST CASES),0
In my case they do,0
atleast in my country/uni.,0
like literally exams count 30%,0
Except me LauLau,0
i mean... server is for coding,0
:python:,0
i would be shocked if no one took it up as a career path here,0
Is this official?,0
more interested in hardware design and architecture than programming but they go together alot,0
okay i don't like PyCharm I'm gonna be real honest.,0
It depends on what you are building,0
i want to buy a Arduino kit but am broke story of my life,0
okay id take pycharm over IDLE.,0
i find with programming that at a certain point the problem isn't being able to build it its finding out what to build,1
(totally not buying a 3080),0
:TopKek:,0
> I hzd to program with the shity IDLE at school be happy 😂@LauLau Jokes on you I have used python visualizer,1
i find it funny how everyone uses VSCode and never even looks at VSCodium honestly VSCodium needs more recognition.,0
about 800 euro,0
that was in hs though,0
800 euro in my country likely cheaper in yours,0
if you can even find the card for sale that is,0
yeah it really is.,0
this is why you use cogs lmao,0
🎵 Seeend heeeeeelp! 🎵,0
what cpu,0
Intel Core i54590,0
celeron 400 ghz xD,0
3.6 GHz,0
Some good ways to customize your windows pc?,0
Winaero Tweaker,0
as in themes and stuff,0

yes,0
@MmBaguette AHAHHAHH LMAO,0
Why in array?,0
ah,0
Atom why,0
so why r u asking it here?,0
if its lua,0
or lua is requester,0
and python backend,0
@MmBaguette This channel is specifically about python; you can try offtopic or #networking/#webdevelopment if your issue is languageagnostic but related to HTTP,1
okay so just installing atomdiscord from atom takes an eternity,0
and my hard drive's right to live,0
> i find with programming that at a certain point the problem isn't being able to build it its finding out what to build@Deleted User This hits home.,1
@Gamer Dog what do you need help with?,0
it's fine,0
just send your source code it will save you 90% of your time explaining the code,0
yah,0
claim help channel I can help u there,0
I mean copy and paste the code,0
,0
Hey is there a channel where I can see like recommended beginner guides etc,0
,0
Thank you!,0
How do we Create a Login System where I can Create and Store Multiple Usernames and Passwords?,0

nope im asking generally. (to everyone),0
no shit pycodestyle,0
@Deleted User Do you have a second account here? Because a different person asked help with this exact problem a few days ago.,1
@Manqkaseebe #❔｜howtogethelp,0
@Manqkaseebe If you have a question you can ask it here. See #❔｜howtogethelp if your question is too long for here.,1
@epiccoolzane what device?,0
python has been ported to everything but a pregnency tester,0
@epiccoolzane If you want to try Python on Android you can try Pydroid.,0
@Manqkaseebe Why not ask it here? It's better to ask it in public because more than 1 person will be able to help you and other people may benefit from your discussion.,1
@cyberchan PyInstaller only builds executables for the system you run it on. If you run it on a Mac it builds for Mac. It doesn't crosscompile.,1

maybe you're just from the same class then,0
or on the same platform,0
its not right,0
omg,0
read it backwards...,0
What happens if I have PyInstaller and want an executable for only a Windows System?,0
But I use a Linux distro,0
"!e ```pyprint(""x y"")```",0
@Vestergurkan :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```x y```,0
"@kendalk08 This is an even easier way of doing that (the `""x""` and `""y""` are just placeholders)",0
No need to manually add the space in the middle,0
If I want a Windows Executable for my Python program but I don't use a Windows OS how could I make one?,1
I didn't read their question,0
@Clyde Refrain from posting gifs random images or memes in ontopic channels such as this one.,0
@Deleted User You'd have to have access to a system that runs Windows to do this.,0
Even a VM should work @Infinimata?,0
A VM ought to work,0

"!e```pya = yo""b = hey""print(a+b)```",0
@✪ SavagePastaMan :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```yohey```,0
omg whats that,0
its for school idk,0
@Deleted User They want to know what text editor you are using.,0
i have no idea,0
@kendalk08 PyInstaller doesn't work that way.,0
What's the program you use to type code?,0
:logo_atom:,0
its edhesive,0
i dont know anymore info,0
@Deleted User Do you write code directly on their website?,0
well i gotta press run code,0
when im done,0
Ok so yes I assume your course provides a web application that lets you write and run code through your browser.,1
yes,0
@Omid.N This is a question that's more appropriate for #communitymeta.,0
@Manqkaseebe It looks like the course they are using provides similar functionality.,0
There's no need to switch to repl.it just because.,0
why doesnt my code work though,0
@Deleted User Ok so when you use input() you need to save the text the user types in somewhere.,0
"@Deleted User You can do it like this: `my_variable = input(""Type something: )`",0
When the user types something and presses enter the result will be saved in `my_variable`,0
@Deleted User After that you can use print() to print it in the terminal again: `print(my_variable)`,0

sa,0
something is not right ive been doing the same lesson for a day,0
im not doing it right,0
what is your goal @Deleted User,0
we cant help with graded homework,0
we can guide them,0
but we cant taell them the answer,0
idle can save files?,0
its a LESSON,0
not a quiz,0
what is your goal,0
@Deleted User what is your goal,0
in the lesson,0
@Deleted User If you just pass a static string like Good morning to print() it will just print exactly that. If you pass it a variable like my_variable it will print the contents of that variable.,1
there arent two input though,0
i dont GET IT,0
@Deleted User Calm down.,0
ss the instructions @Deleted User,0
@Aboo Minister if you're talking about using an HTTP redirect anything you'd want to pass to the new URL would have to be encoded as a URL parameter,1
yo guys does this look ok to you,0
"@Deleted Userthis is a string `""hello world""` if you assign this string to a string for example `a = hello world""` you can do print(a) instead of print(""Hello world\')",1
what you want me to change,0
@Deleted User You already collected the input from the user now you just have to print it. You can print the contents of a variable with `print(my_variable)` (without the quotes),1
input asks the user for a string,0
they input the string,0
,0
bruhh,0
take 2 inputs,0
and print them together,0
@Deleted User read what we said,0
> It's not visible on some systems@6bytes its a global font.,0
OK,0
its on every system that supports discord its just bold,0
what?,0
does code execute faster in one line or is it the same?,0
its the same,0
i think,0
if your doing `;` then the same speed,0
bc the interpreter reads them as logical lines,0
👍,0
not physical newlines,0
@kendalk08 Note that you are not allowed to provide complete solutions to homework problems.,0
no he didnt write hte code,0
You can guide and give advice not solve someone's problems for them.,0
hey guys really cool trick I learned today!```pyimport webbrowserwebbrowser.open('embed.txt')```this will open a file called `embed.txt` if its in your current directory using the default program for that file type!,1
@Deleted User They did.,0
oh,0
@Ping for toast does it create a new file?,0
@kendalk08 The rule applies either way.,0
pythondiscord.com/resources i thinkl,0
!resources,0
,0
@Deleted User not sure. worth trying,0
oops nvm,0
yeah ill try it,0
no,0
for basic data,0
yes,0
like basic numpy tutorials,0
i think,0
@Ping for toast i dont think it makes a embed.txt,0
but it opens it on your breowser,0
it might open an already there html file for you though,0

I look through the website for this discord but I am lost whats a new book on python 3 that is good for already existing programmers?,1
@kendalk08 In case of doubt err on the side of caution.,0
like a book that don't have on first page how to write hello world,0
idk what's wrong but if u need me send full code i can,0
I can write hello world in python 3 by guessing,0
It's better if they solve the problem themselves anyway.,0

I stopped using google chrome,0
I use brave,0
at what point should i consider closing chrome,0
but it exit the program,0
10gb,0
,0
brave = spyware,0
also maybe not have 100 tabs open,0
why does it = spyware?,0
ok guess you are wrong,0
5.8win32brave1 (exact version may vary)  is what the Antivirus software flags. When this happens it's important to note that it is not a virus but rather a component that Brave installs upon first launch (tor files are not included in installer).,1
I use Microsoft Edge,0
totally ok for a major browser to set off virus detection,0
@Deleted User I would not reccomend using brave,0
I don't use anti virus software,0
ya no im good,0
why?,0
rather not have all my info stolen,0
no one has given me a good and viable reason yet,0
@whodissmartguy this is a python server,0
@Deleted User the founder is a white supremisist,0
you guys are mocking a browser with out any evidence,0
because> brave is just fucking sketchy,0
so ok,0
hi,0
do what you want,0
I will I don't take the notions of children who say something with a lack of evidence,0
no offence,0
but I mean using chrome in comparison,0
@Deleted User The founder is a white supremisist and they were injecting referal urls into pages secretly.if you want I can find sources!,1

string = string[:1],0
ah i see,0
VSCodium is VSCode without the tracking,0
Atom is fine however it requires a billion other addons for it to actually work properly. VSCodium is: you install it you install the Python addon you smash your keyboard to write programs and lose braincells.,1
But Atom... Once it works it's cool,0
imagine even using gui,0

@Lim95 seems like you’re using some outdated python code (Python 2). `raw_input` was replaced by `input` in Python 3,0
You really shouldn’t learn Python 2 because of that. The language isn’t being developed any longer and no one uses it in the real world (unless they’re stuck sadly),1

@Deleted User there's a convention where you just use allcaps for a variable. But there are no constants as there might be in other languages.,1
Yeah I noticed uppercase = constant but I was looking for an actual const,0
Guess not. Thanks guys,0

I made an exe with pyinstaller a few days ago. It crashes A LOT compared to running from the script,0
I can't figure why,0

Your program seem to have trouble with some inputs @saby Like 21,0
@saby ```pythondef isPP(n): return [(n(1/i) i) for i in range(2 n) if int(n(1/i))i == n]```,0
> @saby ```python> def isPP(n):> return [(n(1/i) i) for i in range(2 n) if int(n(1/i))i == n]> ```this takes the ith root of n and sees if raising it to the power (without the decimal) will give back the original number,1
practise 😎,0
google ascii colour codes,0
ansi maybe,0
as in break out of the list comprehension?,0
```pythondef isPP(n): rv = [] for i in range(2 n): if int(n(1/i))i == n: rv.append((n(1/i) i)) return rv```,0
@saby i wrote alternative solution want to take a look?,0
There should be a smaller upper limit to the exponent then n but i cba doing the math,0
"```pydef isPP(n): # m^k = n. m => constant. k => exponent. # Perfect Power if (m > 1 and k > 1). # 9 => 3^2. Excepted [m,k] => [3,2] perfect_powers = [] upper_limit = int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) for number in range(2 upper_limit): for power in count(2): number_power = number  power if number_power > n: break if number_power == n: perfect_powers.append((number power)) break print(perfect_powers)```You can optimize it by finding divisors of n first",1
how does a computer compute decimal powers? I think it does this behind the scenes maybe?,0

You could use frameworks like React or Vue for the frontend. They’ll act kind of like the user facing part of the site while python will be in the backend. In the backend it you can do things like managing a database,1

i just need help how to assign an rect to the sprites,0

most of the folks who have experience with things like PyGame hang out there so you're likely to get a better response there than in here,1
i just did,0
Your question can be narrowed to How to check if two rectangles collide and that question can be googled easily@Deleted User,1
i did google,0
hi,0
i didint get the answer,0
So you can't check first link? @Deleted User https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/findtworectanglesoverlap/,0
thats what i searched,0
Does anyone know how to get the extension and the base name of a file? I've tried ```pybase extension = os.path.splitext(file)``` but this would not work with complex file names like `file.tar.gz`.,1
i have already gone to that site,0
It clearly says how to do that,0
@Deleted User give me a minute,0
so any help on my problem,0
"@Deleted User ```pyimport pathlibfile_path = r""A:\\dev\\somefile.rar""path = pathlib.Path(file_path)print(path.suffix)```https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html",0
thanks!,0
path.suffix would be the extension right?,0
yes,0
it would include `.` tho so you can use str.lstrip,0
Or just remove first character something like that,0
i personally don't use any,0
i just get program ideas and create them. If I get stuck i go here or search on google,0
@danny boi tell us your problem in detail?,0
put `print('\')` somewhere,0
it will create an empty line,0
i need help on my problem,0
how do i assign an rect to an sprite in pygame?,0
Also you can stack these print statements obviously to create as many empty lines as you need,0
oh.,0
yep,0
sorry,0
the `print` command has an option `end` that lets you control the line ending for any print. if you set it to just `''` you can print without causing a newline,1
that might be one way to solve the problem.,0
hm,0
found it,0
`print('whatever you want to print end = )`,0
that will stop python from creating new lines so you can print everything in one line,0
did it work?,0
glad to help,0
can anyone actualy help me,0
i never used pygame,0
sorry,0
i need to know how to fricking know how to assign an rect to a gosh darn sprite,0
I haven't used PyGame either sorry,0
keep in mind not everyone is on this server at all hours and that you might get better results at a time when more people are on,1
also @Deleted User  you got another reply to your question in #gamedevelopment just now,0
hii,0
😈,0
@Deleted User You probably can't do that. Store your hitbox(rectangle) in separate variable or create custom class for that,0
i already know how to make an rect,0
i just need to know how to assign them to an sprite,0
I told you how to do that 🤦\u200d♂️,0
@Deleted User you can use https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html#pygame.sprite.DirtySprite,0
@johnnyboi what library are you using?,0

it's .upper(),0

nope,0
You can't instantiate abstract class or call abstract methods,0
Because they're abstract 🙂,0
@SIMP Yes use `@abstractmethod` deco for that,0
@aroundthecircle the best thing for that is to learn to break problems down into the smallest grained components possible so you can tackle each one of them without getting too discouraged,1
Every big problem is made of many smaller ones,0
@aroundthecircle start small make a simple consolebased game or any simple program,0

@Drevin here might be fine what's your question?,0

@Marc👻็็็ the code you supplied doesn't do anything if nb == x,0
do you have something to take care of that?,0
@ntx02 I think in that case it falls through the `while`,0
It won't work if you put it within the while,0
the statements within the while will only execute while x != nb,0
if you want it to do something when x == nb,0
write that outside of the while statement,0
```pythonif x == nb: write your code here```,0

Hey how would I add a variable to a print statement?,0
hey Ejigs,0
there are a few ways you could do it,0
you could do something like,0
Print(“bla bla bla”) + x,0
I’m not sure,0
"```pythonprint(""words  + x)```",0
or you could use .format,0
What’s .format,0
Well what’s f strings,0
"```pythonprint(""words + {}."".format(x))```",0
^,0
Can you do this,0
Can you do this print,0
Oops,0
I meant to say can you do,0
use backticks,0
` `` `,0
print(x+”words”),0
to format ur code in discord,0
you could do that,0
if its an int or float you have to convert it to a string,0
Ok what about print (“words”+x+”words”),0
by using ```pythonstr(nonstring)```,0
or my bad,0
Ok what about print (“words”+x+”words”),0
str() not string(),0
yeah that works too,0
although adding variables and making sure you format it correctly is a lot easier with `.format()` because you dont have to break your quotation marks,1
What’s a function again ?,0
@SοmeDude whats up,0
‘yes’,0
think of functions like a way to store code you can call on later without having to type it all out again,1
‘’’’yes’’’’,0
@Deleted User use ` not,0
I can’t find it lol,0
the key next to your 1 key,0
~,0
I’m on iPhone,0
has that symbol,0
not sure if discord will let u format right on phone,0
Nah it does look hello,0
nope,0
nah,0
I mean format code,0
Oh,0
and it doesnt even indent right,0
even on pc,0
im trying kivy. it isnt installing,0
```python#Writing this on my phone as a test ```,0
oh it does work,0
but it seems like a pain,0
````hello ````,0
> im trying kivy. it isnt installing@💫 | Loess are you installing on the latest version of python?,0
no no,0
im isntralling on latest py yes wo=oth vs,0
```yes sirrr ```,0
I had to downgrade to 3.7 to get it installed,0
ok @Deleted User we got you can code on mobile,0
i think i did it,0
yo @lbak cflyjfyl am cahvs mmk did that code work for you,0
`import kivy3` is this right?,0
Lol I just copied and pasted,0
yup,0
‘’Nah’’,0
kivy3!??,0
nah,0
yes,0
` @Ejigs#9746 ` chill man,0
Sorry,0
> kivy3!??@Kronos idk. i thust searched kivy in pypi using vs and downloaded all of them,0
"> nah,,@Deleted User three `",0
And what does def mean in python code ?,0
it means you are defining a function,0
try pip install kivy,0
Like ```def print ```,0
fails,0
no,0
```def print() ```,0
print is already a function dont redefine it,0
What does that mean to define a function,0
> fellas is it pythonic to use `!=`@Brownie in Motion wdym?,0
```pythondef function(): pass```,0
Idk then... I faced the issue yesterday..downgraded to 3.7 And it worked.. there is a kivy 2. Ithink it might work,1
like this,0
> ```python> def function():> pass> ```@ntx02 What does this mean,0
you just defined a function using def,0
pass just means not to do anything,0
When would you use it,0
whenever you define a function use `def`,0
Can you explain it a lil more idrk what define a function means,0
here @Deleted User https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp,0
You have to use pass because of the way Python does Indentation..,0

same with else,0

what yardshop said,0
it's out of scope,0
tax_amount1 is only defined in the first if statement,0

it's not global because it was defined in a code block,0

Okey,0
please help me,0
No it didn't work @lbak cflyjfyl am cahvs mmk,0
Oh I'm reading something from StackOverFLow,0
It says that when working with a tuple or list you unpack one item at the time.,0
do i loop the list to check if the text is in a text,0
That's why it gives an error thank you.,0
I'll try the solution and come back,0
Yeah it works now,0
No Jack,0
this was the solution,0
:pydis_peek:,0
```pythonfor arguments in correct_bill_spliting: print(arguments) bill k b = arguments```,0
Yeah but you don't need to use the for loop,0
Thanks for the help,0
Yes I am,0
for bill k b in correct_bill_spliting won't work,0
let's try then,0
But why does it work?,0
Well when reading it my first thought was:He is trying to unpack 3 tuples in variables bill k b. But he's looping through tuples so Bill will be the first tuple K the second one and B the third,1
Why does it enter each tuple and grab those variables?,0
Didn't know why it worked but I'll do my research later,0

I can jump into your code to see what's wrong,0
Yep found what caused the error,0
the method is called determinant not makedeterminant,0
changed the `import cramersrule` to `from cramersrule import determinant cramers_rule`,0
looks like that did it,0
yep you can just do `import cramersrule`,0

ye ik,0
just use a standard db,0
ohh ok Well time to learn db.,0
sql or mongo should work,0
ok,0

Ok,0
Thanks you  @Cypheriel,0

ye u have to install so many extension,0

Is there any way to detect Syntax errors in python (just like we detect invalid calculations like 1/0 using `try:`  `except:` statements) ?,1
VSCode,0
> Is there any way to detect Syntax errors in python (just like we detect invalid calculations like 1/0 using `try:`  `except:` statements) ?@JDeepD just run it and fix the errors,1
@pakeke  No actually I am working on a GUI (using tkinter) in which a person has to enter some code for a problem and my script will run it on testcases (just like the competitive programming sites) . But the problem is  if the person makes a syntax error  then the UI just freezes.,1
@Cypheriel  Python is kinda like a mix of compile and interpreted . Expecially CPython,0
These are bytecodes (.pyc) . So technically CPython does compile in rare cases,0
@pakeke  ya but its not saved i guess,0
@pakeke  In my case  somehow mysteriously a `__pycache__` folder (where all the pyc files were) was made in the directory of project,1

yeah that and ^,0
can a dict be appended to a list?,0
so this is has to convert 12 hr time to 24 hr time,0
but it returns the same thing i mean the same string,0
_ _,0
i just got ignored 😭,0
nonno i want it like,0
if the there is PM then it will add 12 to it to make it like if it is 05:23:34PM then it will add 12 to it that will be 17:23:34,1
ohh u meam in the `replace()` no i cant,0
cuz,0
this is from hackerrank,0
i would love to use but i cant :(_ _,0
yeah there is but i cant,0
cuz this is from hackerrank,0
hackerrank is a competitive programming website im doing the practice questions from it for now,0
> @Deleted User yeaohhh,0
but if i dont do `or` then wont it convert only `'AM'` to ` `,0
i want to convert `'PM'` also,0
Oh,0
still it returns the same string,0
> @SFM61319 he also can use the `re` module it may even be better@petr cant ;(_ _,0
only pure python,0
cuz im in hackerrank,0
but it isnt imported in the thing,0
whaaaaa,0
so then i would just import time that would eb better,0
no 😭 it not working,0
,0
how cna i do it then time conversion? 12 hr to 24 hr,0
!resources,0
,0
so anyone?,0
```pythonimport osimport sysdef timeConversion(s): twelve = 12 hour = int(s[0:2]) if hour < 12 and s[7:9] == PM': hour += 12 elif hour == 12 and s[7:9] == AM': hour = 00 elif hour < 12 and s[7:9] == AM': hour = hour new_hour = str(hour) s.replace('PM  ).replace('AM  ) s.replace(s[0:2] new_hour) return s print(time.time())if __name__ == __main__': f = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'] w') s = input() result = timeConversion(s) f.write(result + \') f.close()``` so this should atleast return something else other thn the string passed as a parameter,1
but it returns the parameter itself 😭,0

@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] `no` will be the size of the list. So the maximum index of an item in the list will be `no  1`. When `i` is `no  1` (the last value in the `range(no)`) substitute the values by hand and see what's wrong,1
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] you are using i+1 as an index,0

doesn't C also index 0 to n1 ?,0
C arrays and Python lists are very similar,0

"@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] If you\'re only using `for` together with `range` then yes `for` loops aren\'t very good.But Python\'s `for` loops are really `foreach` loops.```pycats = [""Boris Nebuchadnezzar Cat""]for cat in cats: print(cat + : meow!"")```",1
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] yes how you start them is very different but after that they work very similarly,0

@M_H_9 it means you are running Python 2 code on Python 3.,0
why not: `for c in s:`,0

First: why not `for c in s:`,0

@Pedro. It's having support for multiple languages in your app 🙂,0

huh yeah i guess that could be useful but fstrings are better in most situations,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] all the code.....,0
In most  it's when you need to use your template string only once tbh,0
you need try/except around the int() call,0
It's not reusable,0
wait actually couldn’t you do a variable that modifies for each language and then print that with fstrings? @Doctor,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] could move l.append(x) into try block and get rid of continue it looks kinda weird,0
@Pedro. How would you do that?,0
wierd question. I instruct users to paste code into a .txt file. how would I get my bot to read that file and run the code?,1
well i actually dont know now but i gtg anyways. nice discussion,0
You can't really),0
@Qwerty the big bit is how would I RUN the code I opened,0
you need it around the int(),0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] because if you encounter any error in tryblock it will immediately jump into except block,0

@🦋『Ŏ̷̕b̵͊̀i̸͐͝t̴́̆o̵̊͆』🦋 Is your question related to Python?,0

@🦋『Ŏ̷̕b̵͊̀i̸͐͝t̴́̆o̵̊͆』🦋 If it's not related to Python you shouldn't be asking here. Serverrelated questions go in #communitymeta.,0
@weeblet if you're new to python then learn python first,0

If you were asking if you could change y in function,0
Why not?,0
Okay.. Thanks ..,0
return any_variable_you_could_think_of,0

@petr it depends on what you're trying to hash,0
Then use something like sha256,0
Could somone help me in #helpcoffee,0
Salting means generating a random string and appending it to the plaintext when hashing.,0
It's to prevent people using databases of common hashes to figure out the plaintext.,0
I'm definitely no crypto expert but since encryption uses a secret key I would think salting wouldn't be necessary.,0
i just bought pycharm for 1 year,0
was it worth it,0
> Salting means generating a random string and appending it to the plaintext when hashing.@dementati And then the salt also has to be stored with the hash ?,1
@dementati salting is usually used for encrypting passwords or info like that,0
@Kronos Correct.,0
Because it prevents rainbow attacks i believe,0
@Doctor For hashing passwords yes.,0
Not for twoway encryption afaik.,0
> @dementati salting is usually used for encrypting passwords or info like that@Doctor encryption != hashing,0
@Kronos i know,0
Next person to talk has to delete python,0
Nah,0
lol,0
You can't get the password back from the hash,0
> @dementati but why is this effective@petr Because otherwise people can generate databases of hashes of common plaintexts and map a given hash to the database to get the plaintext.,1
@Kronos Depends on algorithm tho,0
@petr If you use a salt that's not possible.,0
C# > Python :)),0
> @Kronos Depends on algorithm tho@Doctor What hashing algo that is currently used in production (you can get back plain data from hash)?,1
@Kronos i believe a lot of websites might actually use md5 these days 😆 But besides that pretty much none,0
A hash function per definition should not allow you to recover the plaintext in an efficient manner.,0
If it does it's broken.,0
@Ali Dev I don't think anything is specified about the implementation.,0
md5 does not allow you to get back plain text from hash afaik  it just that i has been used so much that most of the hashes are already out there ..,1
is anyone knowledgable in data science to could help me out?,0
Hash algorithms doesn't suppose protecting of the info in a first place,0
@Ali Dev A hash function should give the same hash string for the same input and it should not be possible to reverse efficiently. Beyond that it's up to you to implement.,1
It might be used just to represent some value as a fixed size string,0
md5 is broken I think,0
I don't remember what the problem was but you shouldn't use it.,0
@Ali Dev Please refrain from advertising your help channel here. If someone knows they will see it and respond eventually.,0
md5 is ok to use if you want just to identify an object or something,0
It's like fast.,0
You can improve your chances by clarifying your question in the channel.,0
@dementati also hash functions aren't supposed to be oneway functions,0
what do stuff like agile and scrum mean?,0
But there's cryptographic hash functions 🙂,0
@Doctor Fair enough.,0
Hey @Gumimaco!,0
I was talking about cryptographic hash functions.,0
@Kronos It's a project management methodology.,0
because that's not how you supposed to create a class,0
Is it still relevent ?,0
@Kronos It's usually described in contrast with the waterfall methodology where you first design the software ahead of time then implement it then test it.,1
LOL  scrum is a meeting ?,0
Agile development is iterative where you continuously cycle design implementation and test to adapt to new requirements and information.,0
@Dense Reptile If you're new to python  try text editors not ides.Like Sublime Text Nodepad++ etc...,0
@Vivs There's many smaller frameworks,0
@Doctor how would a text editor help more than an ide,0
@Typho He's new and he's confused,0
> LOL  scrum is a meeting ?@Kronos It's the name of an entire methodology which among other things include different types of meetings you have regularly in order to deal with planning and adapting to changing conditions in a project. One such is what's called the daily scrum where the team meets up and quickly go over what they're working on.,1
hmm.. Thanks,0
> the hash() method is different right?@zeeshanok Different how?,0
As what?,0
It maps an object to a fixed integer range. The default implementation is normally not cryptographically secure no.,0
But you could of course always implement your own cryptographically secure version in your own class.,0
You don't normally actually write it yourself you call a library to do it.,0
hash is just applying a function to a object,0
hashing can be used for faster lookups in a table,0
Cryptography is one of those things where you should never actually implement anything yourself unless you're a security researcher or you are doing it just for fun.,1
https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html This module has cryptographically secure hashing.,0
@VideoCarp Your indentation is off. You're defining set_printing and start inside the constructor.,0
Methods should all be on the same indentation level.,0
@Eric Fischer The government may employ their own security researchers. But the rule still applies.,0
error?,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] you should probably take a help channel for that #❔｜howtogethelp,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] You are mutating the list as you iterate over it in the second loop.,0
So the indices will become invalid.,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] When you delete an element from the list in the second loop there is no longer n items in it.,1
@Shei check out #❔｜howtogethelp,0
So when you get to the end of the list you will use an index that no longer exists.,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] You should break after removing the item.,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] You still can't change the list while you're iterating over it. Write down the elements you want to remove first and then remove them.,1
You would have the exact same problem in C or any language.,0
create a new list and delete the old one,0
"!e ```pyl = [1 2 3]for i in range(len(l)): print(l) print(f""l[i] = {l[i]}"") if l[i] == 2: l.remove(2)```",0

I always have this error how do I fix this?,0
you delete an element so having a hole in the list is a bad idea,0
The size of the list changes when you remove an item so the index n1 is no longer valid.,0
You are not allowed to use that command here. Please use the #botcommands channel instead.,0

You can't run code on hastebin it's only for pasting.,0

Hey @YA ✪!,0
So you can just read the contents from the file and pass them to eval,0
anyone know how to stop a vs project?,0
@dementati any documentation on that?,0
It's just eval(),0
can u use `.clear()` on SETS ?,0
like if your bot is running how do you stop it?,0
kill it,0
the platform it is running in i meant,0
"!e ```pyeval(""print(\'hello world\')"")```",0
@dementati :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```hello world```,0
@Ping for toast Or do you need to know how to read the contents from the file?,0
@dementati nope thats good. so I could do `eval(file)`?,0
@Ping for toast No because file is a file object,0
Not a string,0
"```pywith open(""file.txt"") as f: contents_as_str = f.read()```",0
can u use `.clear()` on SETS ?Not spammming the quesiton just got pushed back that's why,0
ah. cool.,0
You are not allowed to use that command here. Please use the #botcommands channel instead.,0
if u can answer my question pls ping me,0
"@dementati so the final code would be ```pywith open(""file.txt"") as f: contents_as_str = f.read()eval(contents_as_str)``` correct?",0

In Python code it is permissible to break before or after a binary operator as long as the convention is consistent locally. For new code Knuth's style is suggested.,1

for the case of jython it's true @ShalokShalom but it's generally a project with very few visibility,0
it was hosted on hg.python.org before,0
not officially yet @Typho probably later in the day,0
bruh this dude dmed me saying he needs help and he showed me a screenshot he's on python 3.9,0
what the fuck?,0
3.9.0 final: Monday 20201005,0
you can build python3.9,0
the alpha/beta builds,0
ah,0
okay so for some reason open() does not create a file.,0
it's not just open(),0
oh is it json.dump,0
"it\'s `open(""this/a/directory.txt w"")`",0
yes i know that.,0
did you forget the `'w'`,0
i put x,0
ye but he wants to create it,0
x should work to juts create it,0
the day i found `a`,0
which spydey told me about,0
i wonder why spydey doesnt have helper role,0
it is deserved,0
within 1 week of joining this server i got perma banned yknoe,0
dark times truly,0
uhh you do tho,0
quality over quantity,0
I am about to punch my screen,0
i don't think so,0
i tink they give it to deserving peopl,0
> I am about to punch my screenharder,0
,0
,0
okay you two are very cursed people,0
why do you have //,0
don't use `x` if you plan on writing to it,0
oh wait,0
well,0
use `w`,0
u using \\ instead of /,0
and also 2 of them,0
@lgneous it only runs this part of the code if it detects the json is missing,0
oh god that + in the string hurts me so much,0
just use f strings,0
still you can't write to a file that was opened in x mode,0
use w it also creates the file,0
oh wait hold on i might have figured it out.,0
What would be the opposite of `num  5` in Python?,0
num  (1/5),0
Oh my god I'm dumb.,0
> num  (1/5)@lgneous thanks,0
It was my fault that this didn't work.,0
you can't mutate strings,0
you can get an element you can't remove it from the string,0
How do I place some input info given by the user to a text file?,0
uhhhh just save it i guess?,0
"@ThomasK ```pyinfo = input(""Data to store: ) # sanitize the input as needed if needed.with open(""./user_data w"") as f: f.write(info)```",0
@Vivs r opens in reading mode,0
you can't write to it if you use r you have to use either w or a if you want to keep whatever is in it already,1
no please dont,0
@SFM61319 it's not needed,0
.txt is the default,0
actually maybe if you do .txt in it it creates file.txt.txt,0
"```pythonprint("" WELCOME "")f_name = input(""Enter your first name: )l_name = input(""Enter your last name: )age = input(""Enter your age: )with open("".user_data w"")as f: f.write(f_name l_name age)```Like this?",1
"@Vivs you shouldn\'t do it but if you really wanted to:```pyopen(""./user_data w"").write(input(""Data to store: ))```",0
it's not a good idea at all,0
PEP would kill you,0
it's not about PEP,0
common sense would kill you,0
,0
How do I run commands on other files?,0
the problem here is that files must be closed one way or another and you lose the reference to the file in that snippet of code,1
hi,0
run what commands?,0
Making a discord bot made some commands on another file cause I don't want my main.py filled with a bunch of code. I want things to be simple and organised.,1
Does anyone know why this happens and how to fix it?the library is openCV,0
> Learn about imports.@Zilcher ok?,0
no after 3.9 will be 3.10,0
,0
version numbers are not real numbers the `.` is not a decimal place,0
it's a separator for `MAJOR.MINOR.BUGFIX`,0
here the major version is 3 the minor version is 9 the bugfix is whatever was last released,0
every program likely does,0
@kendalk08 it will but when it completes it will close very abruptly so any final output from the program may be obscured.,1
help!!,0
@kendalk08 ok. Just so you know in the future. Many people are frustrated by this at first because they don't know about it,1
,0
bug,0
status 0 for 3 hours,0
> I'm getting word that Python doesn't use SemVer@wnb it does tho,0
@Synoxa this belongs in offtopic.,0
sorry,0
and it's not like semantic versioning is an ideal we should all follow most projects don't follow it and do just fine,1
is there something other than `asyncio.sleep()` to check the time because I need the code after `asyncio.sleep()` to run,0
@kendalk08 running it in IDLE is a good idea for now because you get to save the output consistently. Just note that if your script prints a lot of stuff to the console it will slow down because it has to wait for the console to keep up with the output before it can do anything else.,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyZQPjUT5B4 @hsbnani look at this video unironically,0
@Aboo Minister you could build your own login mechanisms I guess but if `flasklogin` is there why not use it?,0

while julia is definitely good in that area python is still one of the most used language for math stuff,0
anyone needs help in python?,0
No harm in trying Julia but if you're comfortable and productive in Python stick with it,0
python > js. too bad py can replace it,0
blanket statements™️,0
it's not faster than C,0
no,0
it's about as fast as numpy,0
yeah that's the issue,0
their claims are outrageous,0
it's a good language,0
it's not some silver bullet,0
naive C is slower than optimized julia sure,0
but same applies to python,0
:logo_panda3d:,0

@trig there's details in their docs about how to include files in a deployment package.,0
hey what is calling a feature?,0
anyone?,0
@Deleted User explain?,0
@red there's no practical limit to how much you can store in a given object.,0
k,0
`something(x y d=z)`,0
@red depends on what you're putting in there and how you're accessing it. If you have lots and lots of named objects for instance there's a chance you might do better placing them in a dict,1
"like a common mistake I see with beginners is something like `player1 player2 player3,` etc. instead of a `players` dict or list",1
what does calling a function do?,0
@Deleted User it invokes the code stored in the function object passes in any arguments given to it and passes back any value returned by the function (or `None` if nothing is explicitly returned).,1
Goto the function definition and add a new call Stack,0
oh so it verifies the code?,0
@Deleted User no it executes it. verification for valid syntax happens before all that,0
oh ok so can you give me an example?,0
linting,0
"```pydef a_function(): return Hi""# this defines the function object which thus far has not been runx = a_function()# this runs a_function and places the return value Hi in xprint(x)>>> Hi""```",1
@Deleted User,0
k,0
thanks ❤️,0
but @Infinimata i can just print hi right?,0
then what is the need for this?,0
@Deleted User yes but I'm just demonstrating the process. The example is arbitrary,0
> :(> I really need this to work please help@../../../shrekman.exe sorry i am not this advanced. pls grab a help channel if necessary.,1
oh k tysm!,0
hi its night here,0
nope,0
@mark4q ask in #webdevelopment,0
@../../../shrekman.exe what do you get if you type `py 0p` in console?,0
Aha. You have two different versions installed. One 32bit and one 64bit.,0
If given an array[1 2 1 1 3]Which is the best way of removing the value 1 from the array?,0
@../../../shrekman.exe well you can edit the PATH to put one of the two first or you can remove one of them. I don't know if you need Anaconda specifically or if that's just the distribution you were steered towards for something,1
@Aboo Minister this is almost never a good idea. Set it as an environment variable,0
@Aboo Minister they're only available to the program and the OS and they can be limited to a given program session. They're more secure that putting them inline,1
@../../../shrekman.exe if you don't need it my advice would be to remove Anaconda and remove the other version as well since it's a 32bit build. The 32bit edition of Python can have compatibility problems with some thirdparty packages. Then I'd recommend installing the 64bit edition of Python using this: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.5/python3.8.5amd64.exe,1
[1 2 1 1 3]Anyone knows which way is the most practical to remove all the 1 from the array?,0
For some stupid reason the default Python download offered at python.org is 32bit which makes no sense. It's like offering leaded gasoline at the pump,1
> [1 2 1 1 3]> > Anyone knows which way is the most practical to remove all the 1 from the array?@Deleted User filter would be one,1
@../../../shrekman.exe yes but I would honestly rather bite the bullet and work with a clean environment (and reinstall what must be reinstalled) than fight against the odds of having two versions of Python (and one that isn't even the ideal one to use),1
one of the things with Python projects is you learn how to separate the project's environment from your base Python install which makes it easier to reinstall third party packages when you change versions,1
You are just Radar Water,0

@CodeKitten `__init__.py` designates that the code in a given folder can be loaded as a module and what's in that file is executed when the module is loaded,1

@FlashGuard Python keeps a running count of how many objects in the system have a reference somewhere such as being assigned to a variable. When that count reaches zero for a given object it's removed from memory.(With numbers the integers 5 through 255 are cached in memory and not removed because they're so commonly used.),1
@Вэнс Исайя `(a b c d)` creates a tuple and a tuple can never be equal to a string. To join strings together you can use `+`: `a + b + c + d`.,1

"It\'s similar to this: ```pyoutput_file = open(""Output_file.txt w"")...output_file.close()```",0

it allows you to use your own discord account as a discord bot,0

`field` isn't completely necessary and I think your annotation covers it. `field` is good for adding metadata and other stuff to the field but it isn't completely necessary.,1

Hi,0
yep,0
i dislike pygame,0
try pyglet if you are comftorble with classes,0
So I'm making a game and I have a question how2save variables thru different oppenings of game like I open game first time get level 3 leave open again and have level 3,1
How,0
@kekland like how xD,0
how to save variables into file,0
So next question if I did save variables into file  then load them  but like no wait my code is trash and it does default setting all the time wait my head hurts,1
How can I check if variable already exists,0
To not ask for it again,0
Wdym?,0
My brain sees only python,0
Like,0
Python and random module xD,0
@Deleted User what...,0
@Deleted User there are tens if thousands of modules for u to use,0
From random import,0
Or import pickle,0
All I know xD,0
I mean my problem is that I make a game  basic like only setting variables and tons of code that makes no sense and counting things again and again and if I even load this what isn't even existing then name my character set lv to 1 gold to 0 hp pots to 5 do some fight get lvl 2 and save when I load it asks for name again and all that sht again,1
So how can I check if variable ``playername`` already exists and if so don't ask for iy,0

month or two?,0

Is there another way to speed up a single request in Python apart from instantiating the connection beforehand?,0
@Deleted User why,0
premature optimization is the root of all evil,0
🤔,0
yrah,0
> Anyway er yea how would I make a certain set of commands repeat until a certain condition is met?,0

welcome to the i care about privacy club,0
@atlas_core well that's basically how you'd do it. you dhave a `while` block and the condition would be `while not condition:` Everything inside the `while` block would be what you do while waiting for that condition to come true,1
firefox?,0
use brave lol brave is the best browser for privacy,0
and then everything after it would run once the condition is satisfied.,0
yea but honestly google 100% has no privacy cause they also own youtube which is a primarily advertisement based company.,0
that's where a funny neighbor that content creators hate comes into play,0
@Fiji i just wrote some very similar code to that actually,0
```pynumbers = list(range(1 1000001))# don't forget the double )) in the back to end both parentheses.print(min(numbers))print(max(numbers))print(sum(numbers))# the 3 main commands for intepreting lists are min max and sum.```,1
heres what i wrote idk if this is gonna help probably not,0
@UltimateChaos just put them in the list?,0
yea use list comprehension,0
im learning list comprehension rn in my python book actually,0
@CasperLeone I'm not sure what you mean,0
@UltimateChaos you can access them by the index of the list.,0
that's just the text reversed..,0

that's misleading,0

@Infinimata here i edited the message,0
@Deleted User generally if you find yourself needing to do this place the list in a dictionary and refer to it by way of a key.,1
Okay,0

You can get the names of variables in the local and global namespaces manually but use a dict for this job,1

@CodeKitten what do the underlines mean? Hover over them,0
@CodeKitten it's unusual to make an instance that overwrites the class.,0
^,0
they usually give you tooltips if you hover over the squiggles,0
"@CodeKitten yes that\'s the way to do it. Why are your instance and class both called init""?",0
@CodeKitten I don't think u r allowed to ask questions on this channel,0
u have to go to help channels,0
if you are using the class name for an instance chances are you are only using the class once so do you really need it to be a class?,1
@pokehunter That's not the case.,0
or u might get kicked. not sure though,0
You are allowed to ask questions here.,0
The help channels are more useful for longer help sessions though.,0
@CodeKitten what was the text on the squiggles?,0
"well it says general"". could you check with an admin?",0
I am a moderator.,0
^,0
@CodeKitten that seems strange: it means you only have one instance? It could be confusing to use the name over again like that.,1
you called you class `init`?,0
class names are usually nouns,0
,0
"in any case pycharm didn\'t freak out"": it\'s trying to help you.",0

it's unlikely to happen but you have a race condition here. Incrementing numbers from multiple threads could lose an update.,0

that solution is better using zip+slices,0

this is the pythonic solution to this problem,0
if you need me to explain any part lmk,0
what the fuck does that do,0
its a cool effect though,0
s[1:] is s starting from index 1,0
s[2:] is s starting from index 2,0
and then we zip it to iterate over all 3 at the same time,0
ah so it's an offset,0
yeha,0
what's causing it to be locked at 3 spaces,0
because there are only 3 things you are iterating over?,0
yeah,0
im iterating over offset 0 offset 1 offset 2 at the same time,0

and then just join them back together into a string,0

@Vishal It\'s always good to learn more than 1 programming language but it\'s not very useful to know just the very basics of many languages. Python has many concepts to explore: the vast standard library objectoriented stuff (descriptors metaclasses) functional stuff (functools itertools generators coroutines decorators?).,1
@Vishal You could experiment with JavaScript: you can write the backend in Python and the frontend in JavaScript. JavaScript is pretty similar to Python (compared to C or Haskell) so it will not be too much of a shift.,1
yeah i know but he refuse to do that,0

@confusedcheese what's your question,0
@VideoCarp Depends on what you call functional programming'. You can do it with varying success in almost any language.,0
functional programming in fortran,0
Map reduce filter?,0
do you have code written @confusedcheese,0
post your code,0
@VideoCarp Standard and basic are very vague terms. Some functional programming techniques don\'t require anything special at all. For example you can make as much of your program consist of pure functions i.e. deterministic functions that don\'t depend on or modify any state. If you\'re heavily relying on mutable state using filter/map/reduce won\'t make your program more functional,1
@VideoCarp still a really vague definition,0
Basically any programming lang fits the 2nd,0
"@VideoCarp DIfferent people mean different things by functional programming"". It\'s mostly these principles:1. Use as little mutability as possible2. Use functions as firstclass objects",1
what do you mean by normal int/str,0
i'm not sure i understand what's the difference between that and a normal function,0
In Python (and F# and even Haskell) functions can do all sorts of stuff including changing some state so just using functions as much as possible is not functional programming.> also would adding a function that can be performed on a normal int/str variable be possible?> string or integer not including lists/tuples/etcThat's a very weird goal. Never heard of that.,1
oh you want to add methods,0
no you can't add methods to builtins in a sane way,0
yes this is possible,0
@VideoCarp Not using aggregates (lists tuples dicts custom types etc.) doesn't really make sense and I doubt it's possible at all.,1
can you specify your entire problem,0
we have a very obvious case of xyproblem rn,0

Hey @CommitTaxFraud!,0
wat?,0
but it still isnt working he says,0
We use multiple files for our projects right? But what I don't understand is that what we put in those files. Instead of using multiple files why not put the entire code in the same file.?,1

yep,0
tech with tim has a great series on software design watch that,0

awd,0
well I have 300 lines of code. But idk how to manage them iinto different files ?,0
package structure is my best friend,0
bad well depends,0
if u are using it for like really heavy stuff. use a db instead cause json can't handle stuff that fast and files get corrupted,1
@Bugley Using it for what?,0
but idk when to have it in multiple files!,0
like when do we have multiple files?,0
isn't there a clear answer,0
@napsamillion This is a Python channel. For questions about C use an offtopic channels. Or check out: https://discord.gg/MYE3K2,0
ok,0
u have to get chosen,0
no,0
it get's corrupted,0
wait,0
@sphinx Anyone can help in help channels.,0
@Bugley If you're storing only a few values it's fine.,0
Depends on how fast you need to access it :)it's absolutely fine for 20 values,0
fine as well,0
It can handle millions of values it depends on how fast you need to access/update them.,0
"@Bugley ```Json is a data serialization format that turns primitive data structures into a string.A database is a formalized system designed to store and retrieve data with a substantialnumber of features and functionalities designed to support doing so at various scales,and with a large number of guarantees.A Json file asadb is fundamentally flawed due to its lack of atomic writeswhich results in data corruption and loss when: • The disk runs out of storage • The program crashes during the write • The computer crashes during write • Two programs try to write to the file at the same timeAdditionally: ‣ All reads require the entire file to be read ‣ All reads require the entire structure to be loaded into memory this does make it fast! ‣ All writes require the entire file to be rewrittenThe Json module makes no effort to ameliorate any of these concerns because jsonasadb fallscompletely and entirely out of the scope of the standard.If you need the file to be portable and want minimum setup use sqlite a standard designed tosolve all these issues.Using the json stdlib module```",1
For larger amounts of data try a relational database like `sqlite`.If your application is async you need to use async adapters. If you're working with files you need `aiofiles` if you're working with `sqlite` you need `aiosqlite`.,1
why do u not want to use it is written above!,0

i use 2 adblockers,0
"@Bugley SQL might be easier in certain cases.""Select all posts more than 99 upvotes together with their authors""```sqlSELECT p.id p.title p.description u.id u.name u.rank FROM posts p JOIN users u ON p.author_uid = u WHERE p.upvotes > 100;```And now you can try to write that in Python.

the one deadlypants made,0
lists and dicts,0
the second line said blah[1],0
but why did it output the second item?,0
print the second index,0
indexes are basically [0 1 2],0
so 1 is the second index,0
and etc,0
so if i type blah[0] it will output the first one?,0
yes,0
oh ok,0
and dicts?,0
?,0
dicts can be indexed but if the value is a list,0
i dont get it,0

or just personal?,0
"@godlygeek the input is a given number and using the for in range (1,x+1) thing I need to display what I just printed",1

this is what I have done,0

ohh let me check,0
these are the things that I imported```pyimport asyncioimport randomfrom random import choiceimport datetimefrom datetime import import discordfrom discord.ext import commandsfrom datetime import dateimport jsonfrom stuff import Server```,1
oh ok,0
So all i need to do is add `from datetime import time`?,0
ohh ok,0
indentation,0
ohh okk,0
you may be changing between spaces and tabs throughout the project,0
also @godlygeek do u know if we can do this or not?can I use timeout in this way?```pytry: #Do stuff asyncio.timeout = 900except asyncio.TimeoutError: #do stuff```,1
thats the one thing that stinks with python is the white spacing but when you figure it out you can do it,1
let him use what he wants lol,0
this is the most I could do which still doesn't work obviously,0

@vinam do you want to display the list?,0
if yes you can do `print(l)`,0
@godlygeek that's what I've done so far but still doesn't work,0
What def does?,0
def is like defining,0
> Secondly you need to use `datetime.datetime.utcnow` and `datetime.timedelta` instead of `datetime.utcnow` and `timedelta`@godlygeek that was working when I did `from datetime import `,1
a very bad practice acc to PEP8,0
u telling me?,0
yeah `from datetime import `,0
oh and why do u consider that as bad practice?,0
More space bcs u import more I guess,0
what??,0
U import whole datetime,0

I don't know,0
#godly,0
exactly! it's off by 1,0
so I should put a 1,0
ohh,0
or if you are a math freak`triangular(n) = n  (n + 1) // 2`,0
how dumb,0
yes not it works,0
now it works,0
This works when n is small. So you need to know the formula too. Depends on the problem,0
well the second part of the exercise suggests to use the formula and asks which one need less code,0
right,0

@bop We don't allow recruitment on this server sorry.,0

the memory address of a variable is `0x7fffffffdc0c` which is `140737488346124` in base 10,0
right ?,0
@LavaTime There's no practical reason to prefer snake case over camel case the important thing is just that everyone uses the same thing. Snake case was chosen for Python arbitrarily and in the interest of consistency we should all follow it.,1

@Sakamoto One way is to contribute to an open source project. You could for example make contributions to our seasonalbot: https://github.com/pythondiscord/seasonalbot,1

@Sakamoto The standard way to collaborate on a codebase is by using a version control system like Git.,0

@Sakamoto It doesn't let you collaborate in realtime but it's extremely practical and it's what is used by everyone in the industry so it's definitely worth learning.,1

hey is there a library that can allow python to run in the browser off a domain like what you see here https://profile.itsevanb.repl.run,1
"```'pyinstaller is not recognized as an internal or external command,operable program or batch file.```help please",0
It’s basically to let us do other things while waiting for tasks to finish,0
so if we asyncly read and write to a file other things can be executed at the same time?,0
e𝜋i=1,0
what?,0
ohh,0
```py async with open(filename_3) as f_obj:```can we do this ?,0
@Deleted User are you asking why e𝜋i=1 is true?,0
damnnn,0
oh so we can do 2 things in one time?,0
Another example where async would be useful is when fetching data from a website. When waiting for the data to arrive it simply fills that time by doing other things,1

ohh so ima do that for every file i read and write,0
iirc its called euler identity. I forgot this long time back,0
oh it ain't?,0
hello anyone here ever used TomTom api's for maps?,0
Think of it like this:1. You ask for a file from a website2. You wait for the file to arrive (this means you don’t have to do anything other than wait. Time free for the computer to do other things)3. You get the response and keep working with that,1

@xtremedevx There are tools that let you package a Python application for distribution yes.,0
@Stuupie That will achieve the same goal though.,0
How are you supposed to know what it's for and how to use it without documentation?,0
@xtremedevx Yes.,0
> @Deleted User please explain what u mean don't know how to use google map api?@Slow no,0
@xtremedevx Because Python is included in your package.,0
i want video about TomTom's Maps API,0
@Deleted User https://developer.tomtom.com/,0
yep ik,0
@xtremedevx The interpreter is included in the package that you create with the tool.,0
but i need an explantation of these functions in python,0
For example.,0
@Deleted User APIS tend to all work the same  they mostly return JSON with a request.,0
@Stuupie Your explanation was fine.,0
yes,0
if you build it to an executable it will run on any system (with limits of course),0
@xtremedevx From the user's perspective it will look like an ordinary executable but what happens under the hood is that an interpreter is included with your code.,1

By i wanna have control over how it looks though,0
> It also lets you use code that other people have written in your own program.@dementati so instead of writing every def inside one script i can just create an .py file for each function and then just import all of them?,1
pyinstaller is the best,0
it's easy,0
huh?,0
I'm not sure as to what extend that is possible. The only tool that I know of is https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page and I don't know if it allows for customization.,1
@Deleted User You could certainly do that yes.,0
@Deleted User You normally want to organize several related functions in the same file.,0
So you can group functions depending on what they do.,0
yes,0
@Deleted User what you typically do is take the code you're going to share across multiple files into one file and then import it from that one file wherever it's needed.,1
If you want deep customization of the interface you may need to write your own installer.,0
yep,0
@xtremedevx You can create an installation wizard with a separate program.,0
like WiX or something,0
I. e. a nonPythonrelated tool.,0

@Deleted User kite trains their ai models on your local machine currently so it takes up a huge amount of memory,1
@Voidy You might want to ask in #cextensions.,0
@Voidy there's a few ways to do this actually.  `ctypes` `Cython` `swig`they vary in complexity and speed. `ctypes` lets you keep everything in Python for convenience but is probably slowest,1
and yes #cextensions is the best place for a detailed answer,0

@JustOscarJ you'd need to read in the file make changes in memory then write the file back out again. Another way is to read it in line by line then write it out to a new file line by line writing only the lines you want to keep.,1

@Tran Have you tried that with different values for `minutes`?,0
Hi,0
@Tran Modulus of time and `60` means the remainder of dividing `time` and `60` (i.e. `time % 60`).,0
when i say `dict[smtg] `does is try to find the `smtg.__hash__()` in `dict.keys()'s hashes` ?,0
@Tran Think about what you're asked to do: `time` is supposed to be the total amount of seconds right? For example if it's 18:40:21 now then 67221 seconds have passed since the beginning of the day. To get the number of seconds to display you need to get the remainder of dividing `67221` by `60`.,1
i mean when i try to get the value,0
Who from Ukraine?,0
> @Kronos you are pointing it to the key smtg in the dictionary dict if you print you will be printing out the values stored in smtg@UnruffledST what if there are multiple same keys ?,1
i can just return different hashes for the same values and trick the dict right ?> not possible in dictionaries@UnruffledST,0
Modulus is (almost) the remainder.I.e. `13 % 4 == 1 and 13 // 4 == 3` because `13 = 34 + 1`,1
@Kronos You can read this thread: <https://discord.com/channels/267624335836053506/696888596006830201/756616190528585838>Dicts and sets use hashes to speed up the lookup of an item by key.

@Tran Do you know what a remainder is?,0
hi.,0
im new to python and I need help with an assignment can anyone dm me,0
Hey @Vulcan!,0
"@Tran Apart from a few differences (when using negative numbers) _modulus_ is the same as _remainder_. So for example if you\'re given the number of milliseconds and you\'re asked to format that as `S seconds M milliseconds` you can use `//` (integer division) and `%` (modulus):```py>>> ms = 24513>>> print(ms // 1000 seconds and ms % 1000 milliseconds"")24 seconds and 513 milliseconds```",1

@Dylan Technically you can put anything you want in annotations (just don't forget an `:` at the end) but Python doesn't have a way to specify what exceptions a function will raise. You can just put that in the docs.,1

@Kermitdeck oof,0
"@Kronos The default implementation of `==` is `is`"".",0
yes^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^,0
controlled by karens,0
are you the manager?,0
@Kronos You can look into the thread to see how I implemented a primitive hashset and hashmap.Suppose that you want to make a set of numbers. You could do this:1. Create 64 buckets: `bucket[0]..bucket[63]`2. When you add a number: 2.1. calculate the number's hash: `h = number % 64` 2.2. use linear search (with the `in` operator) to find out if `number` is in `buckets[h]` 2.3. if it isn't append the number to `bucket[h]`3. When you look up a number: 3.1. calculate the number's hash: `h = number % 64` 3.2. use linear search (with the `in` operator) to find out if `number` is in `buckets[h]````pyclass MyNumberSet: def __init__(self): self.buckets = [[] for _ in range(64)] def add(self number): h = number % 64 bucket = self.buckets[h] if h not in bucket: bucket.append(number) def __contains__(self number): h = number % 64 bucket = self.buckets[h] return (number in bucket)```This way you effectively reduce the amount of time you need to spend on each addition and lookup by 64 times.The real implementation is much more complex but the idea is kind of the same.,1

For others it simply drops down all the way to the end of program. (This is shortened code),1
i mean i cant just pip cuz its says pip is not a command or program or batch file or smth,1
@Kushal then that's probably because one of the file paths it's being given isn't valid.,0

@blipblop did you want it to be `r.listen(source)` instead of r.record(source)? .record is usually for audiofiles not just microphone input,0
We won but at what cost atom oppened,0
Discord better :),0
UPDATE HAS STOPPED WORKING,0
my pc is dying,0
Right so usually `r.record(source)` is for audio files but if you want something from the microphone you usually have to use `r.listen(source)`.,1
In PyCharm what does the terminal tab say?,0
@PinochonIdolo feel free,0
@blipblop are you using PyAudio or something else?,0
use backticks: ``,0
also str.replace,0
@drfofo,0
@blipblop So it's probably an issue with PyAudio not accurately recognizing the input. You'll want to make sure PyAudio can accurately get the audio or adjust your settings so that it can. This could involve changing the sampling rate or other things,1
Maybe you need to increase the chunk size? It's hard to tell since it's system and microphone dependent,0
actually idt str.replace is the right tool for this,0
use a list comp do the replacement and then str.join,0
@drfofo,0
I didn't have an issue with it so I didn't need to mess with PyAudio apart from going through this a bit and verifying that I could get sound. <https://makersportal.com/blog/2018/8/23/recordingaudioontheraspberrypiwithpythonandausbmicrophone>,1
@blipblop Whether or not I can run it won't make a difference since I'll be using a different microphone than you.,1

You need to configure PyAudio for your specific setup and ensure that it's working accurately. Once you're sure PyAudio is working then you can move on with the speech recognition stuff,1

you can raise it,0
raise KeyboardInterrupt,0
> Hi im trying to make it catch a error when it happened so it respond with saying there was an error,1
That would raise a KeyboardInterrupt error,0
`raise Error`,0
C will work fine because there is nothing wrong. Its just printing a variable. B will work because it is turning a string that ONLY contains numbers into an integer. A will not work as it turns a string containing both numbers and letters into an integer.,1
that's not really python related @buckler,0

`x = str(school_forest_glade['pollution'])`,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html,0
@CumSock because the `input` function has a builtin way to prompt the user,0
@deagleus OpenCV is your best bet there,0
@CumSock correct and even then you could emulate a similar result by putting a `\` in the `input` prompt,0
why noone said that atom is nowhere,0
I think `input` just calls `print` under the hood for the prompt.,0
and yeah,0
its wierd but i found,0
its called string,0
@CumSock it's probably just calling the same things `print` does to display the prompt is all.,0
first person to ping gets toast,0
but does the first person to toast get pinged?,0
anyway,0
back on topic.,0
@Ilmangamer because in the prompt you're running Python in a fashion that works immediately on user input. scripts written and saved to a file work differently.,1

i made a machine to check ur ping,0
just open it and time it will say there is an error is ur ping,0

Hey! Does anyone here work alot with DashPlotly? I would love to work together seperatly on different projects helping eachother out when we can. Dash is a great library but when you start to get to the complex stuff it's a lot of trial and error. maybe we could help eachother out DM me!,1
Can anyone tell me something more about f strings? Like usage or something,0
Also I'm not sleeping I'm bored of sleeping,0
,0
what does what mean,0
But y not use ``print(snake are some of the largest snakes in the world')``,0
I mean u can only have 1 argument in input,0
So you can make question that has variables in it using f strings?,0
sep=,0
or +,0
So,0
Thats making string but different,0
Kinda shorter/easier I guess,0
And how def works?,0
also using `+` to concatenate strings is slow and inefficient,0
sep,0
And spamming spaces,0
like? Can I have some showcase of it?,0
Like,0
Any code where u use def so I can think bout it,0
And what it does,0
what's the difference between a Python array and list?,0
What the fk is return,0
@Deleted User an array in Python contains only one kind of thing integers or floats for compatibility with C. lists can contain any Python object,1
Guess my brain is too smol,0
> @Deleted User an array in Python contains only one kind of thing integers or floats for compatibility with C. lists can contain any Python object@Infinimata thank you,1
Variable in caps is different from no caps by name,0
@dopamine if you're still wondering which one to use pycharm pro has a nice django thing you can use,0
allcaps for a variable name is typically a sign the variable is meant to be a constant and not reassigned.,0
nice,0
So u def my_function as a and then make a as my_function and it kinda means my_function = a?,0
What the fu,0
Yeaahh,0
What Im confused,0
So it's argument,0
I think ik what's argument,0
@Latkecrszy for that you'd use something like `requests` to retrieve the contents of a URL. note that `requests` is not included with Python although there's another package (less easy to use though) that is,1
No wait do it?,0
I do,0
Does anyone know if the @Python bot is opensource?,0
In randint there is argument like first and second number,0
@Latkecrszy read its documentation. https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/,0
Am I right?,0
I need the wolfram alpha code,0
,0
I function....we can create a argument called name and give a value like: sunderw,0
I've spent hours on it but I still can't get it right,0
It means it's custom function of soemthing?,0
> !source@Numerlor Thank you!,0
Or how is it called,0
So,0
It's a function of idk what is it called and u have to give name,0
you give a,0
And a is name,0
But a is Sunderw,0
So you give sunderw,0
And return me and then smth,0
My brain do be not working properly,0
OH FUCK IM STUPID,0
So it's like input? And it asks for name and teaching_sunderw_what_is_function is this waht I type in? But why is it The long name('sunderw')?,1
"```pythondef migratoryBirds(arr): if 5 > len(arr) or len(arr) > (2(105)): raise ValueError(\'List length error (Must be between 5 and (2(105))\')  values = { 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0 } for value in arr: if 1 > value or value > 5: raise ValueError(\'Bird ID must be 1 2 3 4 or 5 \') values[value] += 1 record = 0 for bird_id in values: if values[bird_id] > record: record = values[bird_id] current_bird = bird_id return current_bird```The objective of the program is to receive an array of birds id\'s (1 2 3 4 5) and return the ID of the most common bird.If two or more of the populations of birds are equal then return the lowest ID.Examples: [1 1 2 2 3] should return 1 because between 1 and 2 1 is lower.[3,3,3,2,1] should return 3 because it is the most common bird.Currently this piece of code analizes 100,000 id\'s in 0.122 segs (my computer) but I don\'t know if there is a way of making it more efficient.",1

it was a long message tho,0
But in rules it says that I should only post my code in pastebin if I can't send it in a block of code.,1

;,0
@DuckMan Do you actually have to succeed? Where I'm from it's normally enough to properly document the entire project and the outcome even if it wasn't what you planned to achieve.,1
Assuming the project is OK'd by your supervisor.,0
Not a lot of research would get done if the researchers were fired if they didn't get a positive outcome. Not a lot of good research anyway.,1
Not that I can recall.,0
@ShatteredSunlight Interesting.,0
@ShatteredSunlight It's not necessarily bad I think but it depends on what you use it for.,0
It may be the case that there's a better design for what you're doing.,0
That's certainly a concern.,0
Readability might suffer but again depends how you use it.,0
"I mean you could always just go ```pyf(d[""a""] d[""b""])```",0
Maybe you should refactor your function instead then.,0
Why do you need so many parameters?,0
Complicatedish functions are a code smell.,0
I'm willing to bet there's a better way to arrange the code that doesn't require as many parameters.,0
@Qwerty yes but many of the options have defaults to cover the majority of use cases.,0
Many optional parameters is not as much of a concern.,0
8 arguments is fine,0
Eh,0
most IDE will advise you to stop at 7 but tbh nothing happen really if you have more,0
8 required arguments is a bit much I think,0
ah 8 required then it's messed up...,0
how about you pass in a `dict` instead of that many parameters?,0
@ShatteredSunlight What does the code do?,0
"in the child function you can always use the `dict.get(""key default_value_)`",0
> What kind of loop do you guys use the most@Tavi for loop,0
A dict looks less messy but then you need insider knowledge of the structure of the dict in order to use the function properly which is not ideal either.,1
> A dict looks less messy but then you need insider knowledge of the structure of the dict in order to use the function properly which is not ideal either.@dementati you can use docstring to keep track of it,1
I'd advocate for refactoring the code to just use less parameters and be readable.,0
anyone know if theres way to let Python control your sound output?,0
you can make the `dict` an Object so you know the fields,0
or that's not possible with python,0
@Wasabi That's better.,0
use `@dataclass` or something,0
At this point though,0
You might just want to make the function itself a class method.,0
the more you write and get bashed in code reviews the more you learn and write cleaner code,0
@ShatteredSunlight Sometimes when you have a function with a lot of parameters the best way might be to turn it into a class and make some of those parameters into fields.,1
,0
@ShatteredSunlight But it's hard to say for sure if that's the right way without more context.,0
don't feel sad in your first few code reviews with senior lead and they point out stuff. I learnt a lot in my first few,1
@ShatteredSunlight That seems like it would make sense.,0
> @Spacecraft1013 you right. Question how in the world do I use it for crossplatfrom use?@Isber just use it... it has built in cross platform,1
I have spent 2 full days trying to figure out why a hash that if i copied and pasted it managed to verify didn\'t verify when i did it in my program and i have now solved the issue. Apparently when reading the first line of the file it also readed the \ at the end because i store different stuff on different lines and that made it not work. So take that as you may oh also for Python \ counts as 1 character.,1
@Typho That's not Pythonspecific.,0
ah,0
well yeah now that i think about it,0
Line break is one character yes. It's not actually `\\` and `n` `\` is just a way to specify a line break character,1
if you select it in a texxt file it's 1 char,0
\ is a representation of a newline character which is an ASCII character.,0
anyway this was debugging hell,0
@ShatteredSunlight i already knew they were,0
your future can get worse when you learn about \\r\,0
which is windows way of new line representation,0
beforehand they worked then i added email stuff to my project and put it on a new line on the file for the user so i had to introduce the newline character,1
but before that i didnt have it so it just worked,0
so literally 1 character made me waste 2 days,0
I've had problem when my code failed with CRLF because someone decided to change LF to CRLF and yea,0
it IS controllable i just hadn't noticed that it was there,0
do you generally write type linting in python now or it's still a project by project basis?,0
type hinting? i ALWAYS do it,0
i tried so hard to push for it but people complain it's too java/typescripty,0
low key sad inside,0
oh my linter doesn't ask i just do,0
what's MyPy?,0
Static typing is free unit testing.,0
unit testing?,0
how do you use MyPy? like you run it through your codebase and it generate type hint or you write type hint run it through the codebase then it spit out error?,1
@Typho Are you asking what unit testing is or how static typing is unit testing?,0
I'm trying to imagine how it can fit in a CI/CD pipeline,0
@Wasabi The latter.,0
It checks that you follow your type hints.,0
@dementati what unit testing is,0
@Typho It's a little program that checks that a particular part of your code works the way you expect.,0
huh,0
@Typho search about testdrivendevelopment,0
it's basically a required thing if you looking for job,0
"Normally on the form of ```py# given some setupfoo = Foo()# when running the coderesult = foo.bar()# then the result matches the expected valueassert result == baz""```",1
ah,0
@Typho Serious projects often have suites of hundreds or thousands of these that you run every time you're about to merge a change to the codebase.,1
It minimizes the risk of introducing bugs when you modify the code.,0
dayum,0
Because if you do and you have tests that cover most of your functionality a test will break.,0
i don't understand half of that code but i see you have a function to decrypt password ans you should NEVER have that @Aboo Minister,1
just hash them so no one can read them even if they get the file,0
ahh,0
hmm,0
then you could use asymmetrical encryption,0
safer than symmetrical for sure,0
it's so you know what you coded works,0
ahah imagine having a project big enough that you MERGE,0
it gives you more confidence when doing things because you can catch when it breaks right away,0
@kendalk08 When you have a codebase with tens or hundreds of thousands of lines you don't have time to manually test everything every time you change something.,1
losers... the only time i've had more than 1 branch is when i have my brother review my code and he writes it from start to top in a way better way to show me what can be improved,1
as long as you learn,0
@Aboo Minister no. asymmetrical encryption makes it so you can't use the same key to encrypt and decrypt so you use one to encrypt and another to decrypt,1
i mean him doing that CODE REVIEW is how i found out about try except stuff lambdas type hinting how i started using classes etc etc!,1
this was when i had just started out,0
@Aboo Minister naw cause i got to do other stuff,0
> > i mean him doing that CODE REVIEW is how i found out about try except stuff lambdas type hinting how i started using classes etc etc!@Typho Yeah code reviews are great for knowledge sharing. I'd say that's the main value.,1
@DeadlyPants use `os.path.sep` instead of //,0
@DeadlyPants well after you do find out what to change add an if check that does one thing instead of the other based on sys.platform i guess,1
@Aboo Minister iirc pycrypto is obsolete,0
You should be using cryptography,0
`secrets` i think?,0
it's the opposite,0
@Aboo Minister Ah ok.,0
i mean it doesnt matter cause it goes both ways but you encrypt with public and decrypt with private,0
ah idk what that is,0
oh that's what it's called,0
isn't it called asymmetrical encryption?,0
anyway yeah that's what im talking about..,0
cryptography module is nice,0
ECDSA is a particular type of digital signature algo,0
except for all those imports that are annoying,0
Digital signatures is where you encrypt with the private key,0
It's used to prove your identity rather than keep a message secret,0
Since only the holder of the private key can encrypt the message being able to decrypt it with the public key proves that it was the private key owner that sent the message.,1
@Aboo Minister If you are storing passwords you should be using a cryptographic hash,0
Making your own password manager is a bad idea if you actually plan to use it.,0
That's fair.,0
wait if he needs to get the passwords back he shouldnt hash them,0
Just don't use it because you are likely going to introduce a lot of security holes and your passwords will be compromised.,1
@Typho Yeah I didn't see what they planned on using it for before I mentioned hashing.,0
yes thatìs why i told you not to hash them @Aboo Minister,0
> wait if he needs to get the passwords back he shouldnt hash them,0
please don't,0

rust is so cool,0
and also hard,0
@Bast i thought you can delete the object then pray for the GC to delete it,0
you should,0
no,0
you should learn everything,0
yes you should learn C,0
the new edgy bois are rust golang kotlin dart,0
the cool kids only use kobold,0
tbh if you job searching then learn typescript/js,0
It's vaguely similar to C++ but there are a lot of differences as well.,0
i heard rust and JS/web stuff complement each other very well,0
i dont remember why,0
rust is cool to write,0
when you write it punish you for bad practice,0
I wouldn't say Rust is the ideal web backend language.,0
so your code will not work all the way until it work and then it's just work,0
low chance of runtime error,0
It mainly shines as a highperformance systems language.,0
There was a good article from a discord staff member about their switch from go to rust,0
Even if the ecosystem was mature I'm not sure if I'd want a language with such strict restrictions on memory usage for a web backend.,1
well web technology is weird now. you can run C++ in browser with webpack,0
so yea,0
python java js are the top 3 if you job searching for enterprise,0
@919soyuz I've never used it sorry.,0
once you learn python go for a static type language,0
or whatever you need to learn,0
@Dense Reptile If you want to learn a systems language I'd go for Rust. If you just want to learn a statically typed language maybe Kotlin.,1
C++ is old and not very fun to work with.,0
> whats a static type language?@919soyuz language that force you to choose type of variable and stuff. like C++ java etc.,1
i dont like C++ for the dependency management,0
@919soyuz A statically typed language forces you to declare the type of variables and return values and such.,0
it's messed up,0
@919soyuz Python is the opposite dynamically typed. The type of a variable depends on the value assigned to it.,0
And can change if you reassign it.,0
they're used for many many things,0
yep,0
many video games these days are produced with cpp,0
games web desktop mobile,0
I think it would be better to say that in statically typed languages variables not just values have types?,0
!warn 446784092688744449 I told you to stop posting random images in ontopic channels.,0
:incoming_envelope: :ok_hand: applied warning to @919soyuz.,0
variable and their value have type,0
> @919soyuz A statically typed language forces you to declare the type of variables and return values and such.@dementati because this doesn't really hold true that much since type inference has become so common,1
an easy transition could be going for typescript,0
but i recommend java all big firms use it. and java with functional style is really nice to work with,0
TypeScript is basically Python in terms of typing but better,0
I dream of one day python can do things like java stream,0
no.,0
functional java is too hard for me,0
Java and JavaScript are about as similar as car and carpet,0
> functional java is too hard for me@✪ SavagePastaMan if you wanted to write functional Java why not just use Kotlin or Scala 🥴,1
well it's all because of other people,0
@gm Hm I feel like my explanation gets the point across to a beginner pretty well. Type inference feels like a minor detail that is easy to explain once you understand how type declarations work.,1
> I wonder what my cousin meant when he said learning C is relatively easy@Dense Reptile I would say C is simple (very restricted feature set and low level of abstraction) but not easy,1
i'd like to write kotlin but the firm im working with is not fancy that much,0
> @gm Hm I feel like my explanation gets the point across to a beginner pretty well. Type inference feels like a minor detail that is easy to explain once you understand how type declarations work.@dementati fair enough; it's not how I'd teach it but that works too,1
scala is pretty much a data ETL/Apache spark thing now,0
,0
ah yea true,0
Yeah let's get back on topic.,0
it's definitely an easy way to get into programming,0
i'd say so for me. I start from python now writing typescript and java,0
Python is a common beginner's language.,0
python is so easy if you learn it the data science way,0
> But honestly I really wonder if people can get by with pure Python pure forever@ShatteredSunlight it depends on what you wanna do,1
It can.,0
> honestly im only learning python for use with web development... could care less about full program utilization@kendalk08 django is your friend i guess,1
im a flask guy but sometime i wish i do django first,0
once you learn 2 programming language the rest is just syntax and trial error,0
> @Wasabi ya ill get there eventually... still learning basics/intermediate stuff and syntax@kendalk08 i'd recommend FastAPI and tornado when you have time,1
> I was stupid and never once looked at the definitions and uses of the keywords and spent almost 2 months in vain@919soyuz for python i think the most helpful command i use when learning is `help(function)`,1
i ALWAYS procrastinate so yeah..,0
like!e`help(print)`,0
uhm how to summon the expression bot...,0
evaluation bot,0
#botcommands,0
!e in #botcommands,0
i ran it for you,0
yes,0
use a lot of `help` and `dir` when im learning,0
!e help(math),0
You are not allowed to use that command here. Please use the #botcommands channel instead.,0
just run `help(math)` and `dir(math)`,0
you can see what it do,0
You have to import it.,0
```pyimport mathhelp(math)dir(math)```,0
math is a module you can only use it or refer to it once you import it,0
!resources,0
,0
i highly recommend TheAlgorithms/Pythonhttps://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python,0
chuck it on github and post on reddit someone might jump in and help @kendalk08,0
Github is a site that lets you host Git repositories.,0
Git is a version control system. It's a system that is used for storing and managing code.,0
It lets you keep track of different versions of the code as you work on it.,0
this might be a weird suggestion but watching people code on twitch is also a good way to learn,0
Hi I wanna make like a ban command so like I want the bot to detect the mention so like!ban @Deleted User,1
most people i watch have decent code style/guidelines and actually do stuff,0
just need to avoid the vim master and haskell people,0
@919soyuz Do you know how Google Docs for example keeps track of past versions of a document as you edit it? And it lets you restore the document to a previous version?,1
It's kinda like that except for your whole codebase.,0
If for example you mess up and ruin your code or you introduce a bug that you can't fix you might want to just restore the whole code to a previous state that you know works.,1
how do I undo a cd command on the shell?,0
@WelshWizard The logger is hierarchical. You should use the appropriate module logger wherever you need to log. You can then filter the module tree as needed later.,1
@919soyuz https://pythondiscord.com/pages/roles/ This page describes what roles we have and how to get them. We will not give you any other roles besides these.,1
@919soyuz The next time won't be just a warning.,0
@919soyuz Since you've already been warned the next violation will result in a mute or a ban.,0
Why is it so that every time I try loading a JSON file it clears itself?,0
@WelshWizard You can configure the logging module to log to a file.,0
Alright.,0
So yes why wouldn't you set the root logger to log to a file?,0
It's the root. It implies that you will be logging everything.,0
> if i pass to a function multiple times with local variable lists will the variables hold their values to append to every time i call the function? im struggling trying to reuse old code. but dont want two functions that do the exact same thing.@kendalk08 local variable will gone when it's out of scope,1
If you want to log everything that's what you should do.,0
It's not bad practice if you can store and manage the output properly.,0
The volume of which may differ a lot depending on the app.,0
@919soyuz If you have questions about the server itself you should ask in #communitymeta.,0
the book learn python the hard way have a section very good about function and scope. sadly it\'s no longer free on the web,1
you can easily find a pdf though cuz it used to be free. look for the function and variable chapter,0
How do I undo the CD command on the shell,0
`cd `,0
Just says the path isn't specified,0
As if I'm feeding a command,0
because you are..?,0
Yeah,0
that may be why,0
I've used it fine in Linux before,0
So it's odd,0
@sciencecompliance not really. I bet there's already such utils,0
```python# Directly replaces matching words with the specified valuedef translate(text conversion_dict): for key value in conversion_dict.items(): pat = re.compile(re.escape(key) re.IGNORECASE) text = re.sub(pat value text) return text```,1
Like that?,0
Nope just a dict,0
@styx bot.add_cog,0
huh? u can chain in python tho what,0
really?,0
@sciencecompliance ill take your whole stock,0
Why ? 🙂,0
@styx first,0
@kendalk08 perhaps I missed the part when we started discussing other languages in pythongeneral,0
hey python 3.9 out yesterday!,0
o,0
Is this supposed to clear your JSON file?,0
or today for usa East Coast people,0
`PEP 585: Builtin Generic Types` yay,0
@Wasabi also 3.10.0a1 !,0
no more `from typing import Dict List`,0
hm,0
w+ is supposed to write AND read?,0
@styx ehm... You can just write bot.add_cog(YourCogClass()),0
oh.,0
should use rw,0
Oh my god that's why...,0
It's not hardcode 🙂,0
adding cog to your bot in main file isn't hardcoding,0
any1 here have an issue with sublime text 3 freezing each time u open it,0
Yeah rw isn't valid,0
It isn't 🙂 plus you can create a function for that in cog package,0
Plus a lot of cogs require bot instance how would you pass it to them?,0
xd,0
give me a second,0
i have an issue of sublime text freezing each time i open it any advice?,0
Wait different Python versions (3.8 3.9) don't upgrade and instead stay as individual installations?,0
@Deleted User this is a bit off topic from this channel...,0
how,0
how is that off topic?,0
#pythongeneral,0
> This channel is for general discussion about Python.,0
yes sublime text 3 is a python text interprete,0
not really,0
no loooooool,0
`cmd = message.content[len(config[\'client_prefix\']):len(message.content)].split( ).pop(0)`I just remembered why I don\'t touch Discord.Py,0
Sublime Text 3 is not associated with Python...,0
the only thing is its frozen so i cant send a screenshot to get help,0
@atlas_core ik but i use it for python dammit,0
Jian thats literally me with every line I write,0
```pythonwith open(\'save.pickle\ \'rb\') as f: registered_users = pickle.load(f)```I have saved save.pickle before it is supposed to contain a list called registered_users each item of that list is a object of the class User.This is the error I get:```Traceback (most recent call last): File cashier.py line 4 in <module> registered_users = pickle.load(f)AttributeError: Can\'t get attribute \'User\ on <module \'__main__\ from \'cashier.py\'>```,1
the more code I write the more stupid I feel. but when my unit test pass I feel like I'm genius,1
@Deleted User again it isn't associated to Python directly.,0
what @Jac_k said actually.,0
omg,0
@Deleted User This is not directly related to Python. Asking for help with coffee is for #ot channels even though you may use coffee to program in Python.,1
i asked for help and the help thing closed down,0
just please help me ive been stuck like this for 2 days,0
my pc?,0
try reinstalling it.,0
that's all what i'm gonna suggest.,0
uninstall sublime text and install it back on.,0
snrk so now py is Python 3.9 and python is Python 3.8.5,0

I feel like I could’ve done better but again I didn’t have the time.

“You should add parentheses to the expression”,0
> @Deleted User please don't bump your help channel in other channels.@Xithrius Okey.,0
you did,0
They used to give me errors for not including semicolons there were no classes their libraries couldnt be used anywhere else. They literally taught me javascript before teaching html. Get as far away from CodeHS as possible,1
It’s saying I’m wrong :(,0
mayb you added to the wrong place,0
I’ve tried other spots already,0
Like if you can dont touch that website at all,0
ooh,0
press save,0
Still wrong 😔,0
@uotaf ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ,0
oh,0
The output should equal to 38,0
And my expression already does,0
But it keeps telling me to add parentheses,0
It looks like the error is actually saying you modified the expression when you tried adding in the parantheses,0
oh god i just realized I'm running 32bit versions of Python.,0

@Infinimata I made the upgrade to Python 3.9 with the correct infrastructure but thanks anyway! Might actually upgrade the existing Python 3.8 installation I have (if i don't just uninstall it),1
Okay,0
> @uotaf ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ remove the spaces between the operators@Pedro. that doesnt do anything,0
doesnt hurt to try,0
still same result,0
@uotaf ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ what was the original expression they gave you?,0
Yeah same result,0
well its a test,0
so it wouldnt do anything,0
Th original was: print( 2 + 3  4 + 8 + 16),0
Which got the output 22,0
But I had to make the output equal to 38,0
Hey @919soyuz!,0
> Th original was: print( 2 + 3  4 + 8 + 16)@uotaf ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ maybe do paranthsis in (34),0
why do you have parentheses around the `8+16`? The original as you provided gives me the answer of 38,0
try that?,0
Doesn’t work either :(,0
I’ll try what 919 said,0
> I've seen a lot of code that imports `tkinter as tk`. Is there a reason for this? Maybe to save on typing?@Urkchar yes,1
saves time,0
@uotaf ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ The original as you gave it here gives me the answer of 38 when I run it.,0
well he needs to put paranthesis,0
maybe read what the objective is again @uotaf ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ could have misread something,0
@919soyuz if I run `print( 2 + 3  4 + 8 + 16)` that gives me an output of 38,0
so what?,0
Adding parentheses around the 8+16 won't do anything,0
what does that do tot he result,0
how,0
Python is not confused.,0
if python is confused on a simple equation then i have no faith in cs,0
if either you or Python is confused it is likely to be you.,0
you need a plus sign,0
you need plus sgain @919soyuz,0

,0
@0xParadox welcome,0
@atlas_core what package are you trying to install with pip? `yarl`?,0
@Infinimata yeah necessary for discord.py,0
however from what I've seen discord.py doesn't work with Python 3.9?,0
I'm considering downgrading.,0
@atlas_core https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#yarl You need to use a precompiled binary for it I thinkBe sure to install the version that fits your edition of Python and its bitness. you'd use `pip install` and pass the path to that file as the first argument.,1
@cλloe (she/her) what's the code that produced that error?,0
!resources @0xParadox we've got a few courses and books that we recommend which might be less confusing,0
,0
@cλloe (she/her) what happens when you type `py 0p` at the cmd prompt,0
"what do the cp""s mean?",0
do i pick the highest one?,0
@atlas_core cp means cPython,0
so cp39win_amd64 if you're using the 64 bit edition,0
oh okay so i pick the highest one. got it.,0
@919soyuz the reference Python interpreter the one created by Python Software Foundation,0
@Zilcher not true.,0
Certainly.,0
@cλloe (she/her) try `py m pip` and see if that works,0
@0xParadox we don't like to talk about how much time any of this takes because that puts the wrong emphasis on things. focus on being diligent and applying what you learn in a concrete way if you can.,1
@cλloe (she/her) ok I think you may have a damaged installation.,0
@cλloe (she/her) look in Windows Settings | Apps and Features for any installation of Python that might already exist and remove it. Then install this onehttps://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.6/python3.8.6amd64.exe,1
@0xParadox right I get it. We just don't like to say yes or no definitively to something that doesn't really have such an answer,1
Wew never would have known upgrading Python was that much of a challenge...,0
Python is pretty much my first language I learnt.,0
@Doomah I would hold off on 3.9 for now 3.8 is fine,0
@Doomah although you can install them in parallel and then use a virtual environment to use a particular version of Python with a given project,1
@cλloe (she/her) no your code will not be touched,0
Idk why but I really don't like PyCharm.,0
@cλloe (she/her) however any third party libraries you installed with pip will need to be reinstalled,0
I always feel like I'm not in control of what I'm doing.,0
and again that's why you use things like venvs and `requirements.txt`,0
VSCodium is just:you get the code editor the file explorer debugger terminal problems and errors status bar sidebar extra stuff in the top bar right in front of your face. have fun.,1
PyCharm?So you go in there go through a ton of menus look for what you want get that enabled configure this and even then.,1
@DeadlyPants you create them in a subdirectory of your project. most IDEs and editors are venvaware,0
Atom is kinda the same as PyCharm but I feel more aware of what is happening.,0
@Doomah same.,0
Atom feels like if you want something you really have to customize it a lot.,0
VSCodium just feels natural and allinone.,0
You just install it and smash your keyboard trying to write code.,0
and lose braincells.,0
@cλloe (she/her) it might be a good idea,0
Hey @taytertest!,0
@chris. you can start here and move to a help channel if it gets intense,0
a help channel is also a fine option,0
@Doomah wdym?,0
@Doomah i deefinitely get that. I just undid a thing that was too complicated.,0
@cλloe (she/her) did you use the add Python to PATH option when you installed?,0
@cλloe (she/her) what do you get when you type `py 0p` this time?,0
yeah i always feel the need to go through and optimize stuff or try adding special functions I'll never need like adding a Discord Rich Presence functionality for my Discord.py bot project like who's ever gonna use that,1
@cλloe (she/her) what about `py m pip`,0
I don't even use it lmao,0
@cλloe (she/her) ok then it's working with that command.,0
@cλloe (she/her) just use `py m pip` instead of `pip`,0
@0xParadox yes they are very similar,0
@Doomah yeah I get what you mean.,0
@cλloe (she/her) did you restart?,0
Hey you can never have too many error handlers.,0
(except when your lines of code is 1 MB you've got a problem if you reach that with Python),0
@0xParadox one is hardware one is software.,0
@Doomah what are you doing that requires so many error handles?,0
my discord bot is 156 KB and that's not even a complete bot!,0
literally the only functional thing is the warn command,0
i dont even have ban/kick commands yet,0
sys.exit() is cool.,0
great use case of it,0
wheres the any key,0
"press r""i only see R what do i do",0
@diehardthrillridefan #❔｜howtogethelp,0
why do i also feel worried that someone might abuse my discord.py bot to actually gain control of my computer,0
i know some time i made my bot save any errors that had happened to the bot (including missing commands) so people would just ping my bot going @atlas_core whats up @atlas_core fuck you @atlas_core pee making an absurd amount of saved error logs.,1
so thats why God invented if not statements.,0
now if some idiot decides to go ooga booga im gonna talk to a roomba they dont fill my computer with text files.,1
a more detailed answer than that would basically involve pointing you at the cPython source code if that's what you're curious about,1
so it could be possible to convert Python scripts to C++?,0
You could use a `class` object to represent such a thing in Python,0
@atlas_core well there is Cython which more or less does that,0
woah.,0
@taytertest dont trust random EXEs off the internet.,0
@atlas_core but it's not a magic wand  it's mainly useful for numeric code that you can provide type annotations for. I use Cython,1
ah.,0
@Doomah That's a great idea actually!,0
Big brain move!,0
that means theres something fishy going on.,0
@0xParadox this wouldn't be the channel for it anyway.,0
,0
stop breaking rules bro,0
it's against the rules bro,0
jesus man just chile,0
does anyone knows why do a numpy array appended values display like this?,0
How do I print the type of an object?,0
Like only the type of an object?,0
That's gonna print <class string'>,0
I just want the string,0
"```py>>> type(""hello"")<class \'str\'>>>> type(""hello"").__name__\'str\'```",0
Thanks a lot!,0
@DeadlyPants if your shell is in `home/johndoe` when you run the script that's going to be the current working directory,0
@DeadlyPants the shell is what you type commands into.,0
@VideoCarp they're called functions. Seriously,0
@VideoCarp you only want to use lambdas in a small number of situations; if you need a multiline lambda just make a function and be done with it,1
@VideoCarp can you explain better?,0
@VideoCarp I see but what does Python's approach to this have to do with it?,0
@VideoCarp so you're writing something that transpiles to Python?,0
... you don't want to use `exec` for this ever.,0
No.,0
Most interpreters tokenize the input then turn it into an abstract syntax tree and then turn that into a set of instructions for the interpreter's runtime,1
There's no onetoone correspondence between the code you put in and the instructions that are actually executed.,0
I think you might want to read up on how interpreted languages work before you attempt an exercise like this,0
You'd still need to read up on how this kind of thing works even for a transpiler.,0

and you just want a flat list of floats,0
you need to make a separate list outside the loop,0
Don't need the inner loop,0
And then append wordList to the outer variable each loop,0
so then you get a list of lists of strs,0
if you only want a list of strs then use extend instead of append,0
@2days,0
actually you can do just pip on recent linux versions,0
assuming python2 pip isn't installed,0

guys I written an algorithm mainly based on `import random` do you know if this library is using Mersenne twister?,0
what by default?,0
ah nice,0
thanks I just read the docs now,0
mods can we ban narply thanks,0
anyway I am using it for a genetic algorithm,0
that I have coded and wanted to make it even more random but I think mersenne twister is the maximum right?,1
is this a valid list comprehension?```py[for send_mute in mute_them]```mute them is a list,0

@SparkyDoc2k7 python is not good for game development and pygame is the only reliable game development tool with good documentation.,0
@🦋『Ŏ̷̕b̵͊̀i̸͐͝t̴́̆o̵̊͆』🦋 Doesn't matter really,0
Why would you need to optimize that in a first place?,0
@SparkyDoc2k7 python is slow and lacks the proper tools for game development also there aren't really universal readers for python so you have to include a interpreter in your package. Python is great for web development and such not so great for game development.I'd recommend C# or Java (more c# than java for game development),1

@ImPoSter can you tell me how you hacked wifi,0
F,0
at 11 i was watching dragon ball z and that was it,0
⚙️,0
It's c=d and c is of type int,0
The syntax is completely fine and very standard,0
It's the same as `shorten(url nbytes=5)`,0
Except we tag `nbytes` as an int,0
No > is not outdated it's for specifying return values,0
Keep in mind the python interpreter doesn't actually do anything with the type hints other than storing them,0
Pretty sure the bots written in that server use them a fair bit,0
Yeah again the interpreter doesn't do anything with them,0
No it's for annotating variables and functions,0
You're free to do whatever hack you want with them tho,0
Static analysis tools can be used to enforce them,0
Such tools used to use comments before but it's ugly to have comments have an impact on the actual code,0
It also made it much more limited,0
It wasn't only in docstrings,0
https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python2.html,0
Hence why the proper language support was added,0
What kind of syntax would you prefer,0
Why is there a relation from int to a,0
annotations were originally designed to be more than just for types,0
gift me nitro pls,0
A: X suggests that there is a relation from A to X not X to A,0
and it looks weird too,0
can some one gift me nitro,0
like static typed languages but with a colon between,0
why would someone gift a random a nitro,0
At least remove the colon that'd please the c syntax gods,0
for no reason,0
but that messes up normal syntax if you remove the colon,0
no lang does int:a,0
It's either int a,0
or whatever haskell does,0
a :: Integer,0
or something like that,0
so python is just following precedent that doesn't mess up the rest of the granmar,0
any idea should work,0
thats only because you don't know haskell lmao,0
haskell is cool,0
if you know how to use it,0
plus other functional languages,0
uh,0
and your solution is a random syntax no language uses?,0
that is what happens if you combine both predominant syntaxes,0
uh,0
the colon makes it weird,0
A: has precedent b: is intuitive like a is a int,0
because the colon won't make sense in your syntax,0
int is an a,0
What are the things that we are supposed to know to land a as a web dev (self taught) ?,0
!phython,0
That's it? I don't think so..,0
you don't really need to learn both flask and django,0

> haskell is a damn near illegible language to begin with its probably not a great idea to mimic it.@zoidberg 😔,1
to each their own,0
> @zoidberg 😔@lgneous hurt,0
but I prefer a syntax that follows other langs and makes intuitive sense,0
Mfw Haskell (and other fp languages I assume) are unintelligible but every language end up copying their constructs 30 years later 😔,1
haskell seems weird because the syntax is more based on math,0
and counter to conventional langs,0
the convo started with bikeshedding about type hint syntax,0
I remember coconut being interesting but there was some quirk I dislike I can't remember,0
conventional meaning widely used in the real world,0
ok just salty that it doesn\'t follow c,0
haskell was created in the 90s iirc,0
I think ml is even older,0
It is,0
ML is from the 70s,0
yeah python lambda literals are kinda bad,0
too verbose compared to other langs for my tastes,0
but i guess that's the python way,0
It makes a lot of sense as in Guido doesn't want people to do FP so you make the syntax as bad as you can so that nobody ever uses them,1
Well you'll be happy with pep 622,0
Despite it relying on... Strings ugh,0
wait pattern matching got accepted?,0
It will,0
The way they're pushing it shows there are no plan to reject it,0
At least the protocol is much saner,0
The initial proposal was bad,0
I still think pattern matching has no place in a language without product+sum types but eh I'm not a language maintainer,1
Yes and python doesn't have sum types,0
Yes you very much do,0
Oh well with that view I agree,0
But the duality of product+sum types is what makes ML langs so good,0
Inb4 python 6 is static and adds pi types,0
With that logic you don't need anything but ints,0
The tools we use in this case the language should help us write more expressive programs in a safer way,0
Classes really don't change anything,0
!resources,0
,0
They're glorified dictionaries with constructs for code reusability,0
In a nicer syntax,0
I'm not talking about adding GADTs,0
Just ADTs really and even then I'd just be fine with not having PM in python at all and keep it that way,1
doesn't typing have union types already,0
Sum types are not that kind of union,0
You use a tag to know what type it encloses not if forests,0
Or case forests from 3.10 I guess,0
forests?,0
what should i do?,0
pip install pycryptodome,0
done,0

same error,0
done,0
no change,0
@Mudy use anaconda,0
lol k,0
> Which is imo no worse than pattern matching on data constructors@lakmatiol sorry had to hop in my train this works fine for simpler types but not for more complex ones for example how would you match on a list[int] given the current PM proposal,1
You'd have to define aliases manually and refer to them in the case instead of directly using list[int]() or whatever the new syntax if any is,1
And obviously it wouldn't be checked at runtime you'd have to rely on type checkers,0
I mean sure but that's the problem there's no actual way to specify homogeneous types,0
not able to use Crypto.Util.number what to do ?,0
Oh I need to check the syntax for binding are they still considering :=,0

@Rozio ask away,0
does your computer have a graphics card,0
if so is it a nvidia one,0
if so is it relatively recent,0
that highly depends on what he's doing tho,0
trying out TF on the iris dataset requires like 50kb of VRAM,0
again depends,0
if he's just trying out tensorflow 1GB is completely fine,0
if he's doing binary classification on (not huge) CSVs it's completely fine,0
what is your graphics card @Arian,0
ok it should be capable of using CUDA9 and probably 10 then,0
no it is installed or plugged in rather,0
what did you get when you followed the CUDA installation instructions,0
yes if you haven't already,0
go on nvidia's website and follow the instructions,0
then try to install cuda 10 (or 9 if you use TF1.12 or less),0
then it should work,0

I'm fairly new to programming and I've recently completed my unis introduction course and made a few small projects anyway I'm looking to start on a big project I've had on my mind for a while however before I do I want to find out what the best tool/language would be to accomplish what I'm after and make sure it's capable of my requirements.What I'm looking to do is create a web app that allows user to interact in realtime by posting messages like discord but rather than a simple timeline with each post appearing after the other and appearing at the bottom while the old messages are pushed out of sight at the top... the design of the GUI I'm after would instead have posts expand outwards in all directions from an original post think like a postit note on a corkboard with other postit notes being added adjacently to it and spreading outward in all directions.The user would need to be able to pan around by clicking and dragging the mouse like how it works in some graphics editing software or strategy games. Also when the post/note is created it would need to be sized depending on the content.Alright so if anyone could give me some recommendations for what languages would work well for this thank you.,1
japanese i guess?,0
haha,0
cuz japanese ppl write from top to down right?,0
lol,0
its pretty,0
😱,0
god is here,0
@RyanB Heyy I missed :: in the solution,0
oh so you were talking about programming language!,0
i thought languages we talk in,0
alright cool when it comes to realtime interaction between users is there anything i need to watch out for?,0
wrong syntaxes,0
they are the worst,0
yes while spam is oen thing,0
and yeah the format of the user input too,0
but then is the laungauge i use gonna effect it?,0
cuz if the program expects an integer and the user writes a string its gonna crash,0
sure i should be able to work throught that sort of problem,0
then thats all i got,0
good luck!,0
how can i `split()` a string into a list,0
thanks,0
i mean every character as a different element in the list,0
oH,0
> how can i `split()` a string into a list@Deleted User split?,0
nono split does it in one element,0
> i mean every character as a different element in the list@Deleted User `list[this is a list]`,0

> am i lagging or does @Deleted User have no pfp@TheJuiceTin he does not,0
yup,0
and dicts?,0
wlcm,0
and libs too,0
well how do i import stuff and why do i need to?,0
ive never seen a web app like what im describing where the webpage isnt a fixed size but rather expands in all directions and resizes to fit new content in realtime (no page reloads) is that possible?,1
i dont,0
hv one :D_ _,0
like```pydict[this this this]```right?,0
yea^,0
cool i remember that game ill go see if i can find out what it was written in,0
yeah,0
is there an official server for java too?,0
i dont think there is,0
no like here we help only with python,0
so there should be another server for java,0

hi guys im new to this discord and have been using python for quite a while now i recently learnt the basics of pygame(maybe 3 days ago) and have built a dungeon crawler map concept but i have never used or heard of classes until about an hour ago and i am not sure how i should implement them would someone mind giving me some advice?,1
just what situation to use them @RaderH2O,0
Maybe he is asking a blueprint or smth,0
like do i have them for every character of is the whole game one big class?,0
> It says 14.8 greater is required@Deleted User Not this is zero. Bad screenshot quality,0
Oh ok,0
classes are the canonical way to define types in python it helps you separate your code into units of data + logic packed together,1
does someone mind me linking my code and just point out good spots to create a class instead of what i have? so i get a rough idea of when to use them?,1
i have it as a file on my pc,0
what is a block?,0
ohh i see,0
so lets say i have a scrolling map a player and 2 enemies would i creat a class for every single one of those,1

hello,0
that's fair they are pretty different beasts than IDLE,0
hmmm?,0
all the imports?,0
learning the popular modules in the stdlib is an entire part of learning python,0
then depending on what you do with python you will want to learn some 3rd party library as well,0
Well everyone starts by doing that.,0

I'd even argue you should never learn anything by heart if it's directly applicable,0
just build stuff with it,0

@> ~ < what do you mean by indentation?,0
well the dictionary is 5050 values so 2500 values thats why it needs to be in a txt file,0
i have got another program used to design the maps ill add that to the github as well,0
@> ~ < i guess yeah is there a better way for doing that?,0
i just found an easy way to write to the text document on my map creator.py and an easy way to read said data on the map.py,1
so i used that,0
yes hi,0
what is JSON? im noob,0
isn't that just syntax?,0
so how do you save that?,0
ok ill look up a tutorial,0
so what is SQL?,0
so why use JSON over .txt? is it a smaller file?,0
Json is like better txt,0
ok,0
Idk about easier that's subjective. But typically better,0
like frecnh?,0
ok so i have found out what JSON language is but how do i create a JSON file? is it just a txt saved as .json? like how you might creat a .bat?,1
> It's like :> ```sql> SELECT  FROM users;> ```@RaderH2O that's not json,0
,0
i thought you said it was SQL,0
my bad then,0
Pretty sure he was looking sql there,0
Hi Is python or Java more USEFUL and what are the major differences?,0
Uh....,0
they're both very useful and there are too many major difference to list in a single discord message,0
idk preference maybe?,0
That's the best way to put it,0
if you don't know which one to start with flip a coin,0
so like I can do something with python and then do the EXACT same thing in Java,0
these 2 are extremely bold claims,0
Kkkk,0
what is the difference etween java and js?,0
like hugely bold claims,0
Agreed python took a big pike in use,0
@Jac_k ok,0
java is still like in the top 3 most used language idk where you guys are coming from,0
where is python in comparison?,0
probably 2 or 3 too,0
JS is the most used by far,0
because it has no alternative for frontend,0
i have a feeling we have dipped our toes in an endless hole,0
hey i have list which contains number from 1 to 10i want a random number between 2  6 from that list  how to do that,1
JS is not an old language if that's what you're implying,0
"import randomrandom.randint(1,6)?",0
is that how you use random module or am i going crazy?,0
I\'m not sure how learnt is relevant when talking about the community of a language,0
"> import random> random.randint(1,6)?@zdwlees but from a list like  value = [2 30 45 54 21]",0
this is from the stackoverflow survey of 2020 for the most used languages,0
Java or JavaScript,0
"oh then you do this:import randomvalue[random.randint(2,6)]",0
@!Very Good did that work?,0
> @!Very Good yes get a random number between that range and pass that as the index@Feroz what if i dont know the numbers so like can i use  random.choie(value[0 to1]) something like this,1
@!Very Good try this,0
> ```py> mylist = [1 50 27 58]> random.choice(mylist)> #a random element from mylist```@RaVen i want to select between a specifies legnth like mylist[2] to mylist[4],1
"value[random.randint(1,5)] this will get a random one of either the 2nd 3rd 4th 5th or 6th number in the value array @!Very Good remember that when you call an array the first value is 0 the second 1 ect",1
~~you can use `random.randrange` too btw~~once again i'm slow,0
"> value[random.randint(1,5)] this will get a random one of either the 2nd 3rd 4th 5th or 6th number in the value array @!Very Good@zdwlees let me try",1
i only reccomend this because i learnt it like 2 days ago,0
@!Very Good also remember to import random at the start of your code,0
@zdwlees thx thats what i wanted it worked,0
does pynput still work,0
THx Yall,0
@!Very Good cool no worries im new to python as well,0
👍,0
lib,0
module,0
pynput module,0
@Jac_k but its kinda not working,0
or the docs arent updated,0
well in the docs u need 1 arg only but now u need 2,0
well basically most functions,0
yes,0
keyboard.press(i)keyboard.release(i),0
this is how it said on docs,0
i think i found issue,0
thx,0
i forgot to put bracket,0
now it works,0
thx,0
"hey i have a list of numbers like [30 45 60 40 15 65 85 20] i want minus a number like 2 from the number of that list like302 452,602 any solution",1
ok does anyoneknow why proxyerror occurs when using requests in pythonanywhere?,0
> From every number? @!Very Good@Jac_k yes,0

👍,0

@!Very Good everyone else in here probably is better than me but personally i would dofor i in range(0 len(list)):list[i] = list[i]  2,1

Hi,0
@canny i learnt it a few days ago i can send you the link of what i used,0
> @!Very Good everyone else in here probably is better than me but personally i would do> for i in range(0 len(list)):> list[i] = list[i]  2@zdwlees thats a little complicated lol im not pro in python 😁,1
@!Very Good thats the simple method lol: basically what happens is it run this for loop until i equals the length of the list(e.g. if the list had 4 values the length would be 4) and every time it changes the list index(e.g. list[0] i the first value) by 2,1
@canny https://pythonprogramming.net/pygamepython3part1intro/,0
as i said im also new so yeah ask these guys first,0
im just learning pygame to get an idea of how i might go about things in say unity it is like the first draft,1
i mean just to express my ideas on display rather than paper,0
its a python library for graphical display,0
not neccaceraly game dev but most use is that,0
so would you reccomend a game engine like unity? or a different language like js?,0
im gonna learn python just so i can get the basics of programming but i might try c# is future then,1
is UE unreal engine?,0
> @!Very Good thats the simple method lol: basically what happens is it run this for loop until i equals the length of the list(e.g. if the list had 4 values the length would be 4) and every time it changes the list index(e.g. list[0] i the first value) by 2@zdwlees that works and now its easy for me to understand for loops Thx buddy,1
@agbd you need to keep checking the input every time the whle loop runs,0
not using a mouse makes me fuzzy inside,0
@!Very Good cool,0
@Luckayla that's a very hot take given vim and emacs are not just terminal editors,0
in fact emacs is considered worse when not used in a GUI,0
@!Very Good dm me if you need anything else i probably only have 3 months more experience than you so i can explain things quite well in a simple way,1
you can make them as pretty and IDElike as you are willing to work on them,0
> @!Very Good dm me if you need anything else i probably only have 3 months more experience than you so i can explain things quite well in a simple way@zdwlees sure thx bro,1
guys i got an issue im trying to save a dictionary as JSON but it doesn't like me having a tuple as the key,1
any work around?,0
"yes e.g. test = { (1,6): hello }",0
well it works in python having a tuple as the key,0
,0
so not possible?,0
so tuple works in python not json and list works in json not python,0
"it is a (x,y) coordinate",0
"but in my code i wanna call test[x,y]",0
JSON keys must be strings,0
the only reason im doing this is to save data would SQL allow it?,0
dont get a book use stack exchange lol,0
this 2 solve different problems @zdwlees,0
stackoverflow and friends are for getting a quick answer not teaching you a subject,0
Yeah making projects is the best way to learn,0
yeah but what you need to do is make a couple of codes and anything you don't know use stack exchange and then boom,1
sklearn is not suited for computer vision tasks,0

do you want to list numbers from 1 to 10?,0
they used `j`,0
what is append?,0
?,0
i mean where is it used?,0
yes,0
oh k that was what i was askin,0
thnx,0

Where can I ask questions about creating an api on Python?,0
@Feroz I want to try to create an api for the game it's necessary for my bot,0
Api is freely available only to receive information,0
And I need to create game rooms to implement,0
Is this going to be a difficult task?,0
I need to create a lobby in the game,0
But api does not give,0
Brawl Stars :D,0
,0
@LuckaylaThere is one bot There is one bot associated with this game He creates rooms but they don't talk like,0
we do not help with school work,0
dont spam,0
yea,0
Reeeee?,0
@Feroz he send rule 5 not for me,0
It's so hard to understand you through a translator xD,0
about what?,0
i was offline for lik 10 sec,0
they do?,0
its a good game btw,0
@Feroz did you read the question,0
Hi,0
hi,0
@Feroz You're not saying what I asked.,0
k dont fight and clutter this channel guys!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
Hey what's going on here,0
fights,0
Ohh stop fighting,0
they have i guess,0
Yr u guys fighting,0
:),0

its an illegal dice,0
@Feroz he wants to create lobbies in a 3rd party game automatically,0
nothing to do with databases,0
> um I don't think there's law against weird dicesit should be illegal,0
it has nine,0
@Feroz The Free Access Api only gives you the right to receive information and I'm trying to make the creation of a game lobby through the code,1
or it can be a weird tic tac toe,0
idk,0
unless you get the source code,0
then you can,0
forbidden to talk about selfbot not for discord?,0

@kojimabtw ☭ Thank you. Let them know that unless they start speaking English I will be forced to mute them.,0
the code```def run(self): while True: func args kargs = self.tasks.get() try: func(args kargs) except Exception e: print e self.tasks.task_done()```,0
not work .,0

@dementati Can I speak Russian in Russian language that they would use English?,0
Just not everyone knows the rules,0
@kojimabtw ☭ Yes you can tell them.,0
Ok,0
"```except Exception,e: print(e)```",0
@Feroz,0
so?,0
this still doesn't work,0
you need to except `Exception as e`,0

does that matter?,0
bruh,0
yes,0
@hmmm no,0
are there any difficulties in coding in java in a python editor??,0
well you clearly are,0
what?,0
the comma in except plus print statement is both python 2 syntax,0
i use VSCode,0
@Ilmangamer `input()`,0
so it would work?,0

Emacs or vim which one do you guys use? I use emacs because that was what I was introduced to by my dad so I've been just using it since. I don't use vim but alot of people use it.,1
@Luckayla well if you had to choose which one?,0
do edited messages ping?,0
🤔,0
notif and all?,0
Ah... thank you,0
its not javascript,0
there is no === ig,0
`==` in normal langs is the same as `===` in js,0

In our PHP projects we were spoiled with really nice email libraries  like PHPMailer and Symfony Mailer.Is there a comparable wellknown defacto awesomest email component used by Pythonistas?,1
To learn python is it better to use a book or youtube videos,0
@Luckayla someone said to me think about what you want to make with python and lesrm like that,0
@Дэниел Эддисон 💜 I'm also new to Python and I have found that anything you can read on https://realpython.com is pretty good for helping you learn.,1
@abel_km Have you heard about logarithms?,0
@Screentapper this link helps me so much thank you for helping me out,0
@_ItzMax_ It will go through all the elements in a list and check if one of them is equal to `200` so it's O(n),1
@abel_km If the size of the input is not constrained (i.e. the input doesn't have an upper bound) there's no O(1) algorithm for that. If it is constrained you can use logarithms (`mag.log` or `math.log2`) here since you're trying to find `n` given `2n`.,1
(it's log),0
@abel_km Right that's what logarithms are for,0

i got a json not writable problem,0
@Deleted User random,0
we can't really know that without knowing what you know already @Deleted User,0
that is useful,0
i kinda know all the basics,0
like are you familiar with most of the standard library ? if not i would start there,0
and little of the intermediate stuff,0
> like are you familiar with most of the standard library ? if not i would start there@lgneous Hmm lemme see what all are in the standard library,1
there's a lot of stuff in the standard library,0
also what do want to make with python suggesting someone to learn flask when they have 0 interest in web development is probably a waste of time,1
@xtremedevx So will a simple split() not be sufficient for your needs?```pystr('Microsoft .NET Core Host  3.1.8 (x64)').split(sep='')[0].strip()```,0
https://docs.python.org/3/library/ most was an overstatement but there you go,0
😟 I didnt know there was so much in the standard libary,0
I'd expect most python programmers to roughly know:re datetime collections copy math decimal random itertools functools pathlib os sys glob shutil sqlite3 io argparse threading multiprocessing asyncio json base64 urllib typing unittest dataclasses,1
> could you explain how it works though?@xtremedevx That site does explain how it works (in the righthand column),0
i'm probably forgetting some and not all of them are as important as the rest,0
"hey how can i make this code more wrong input resistant""?",0
"```pya = input(""Enter your first number: )b = input(""Enter your second number: )c = input(""Enter your third number: )if a < b < c: print(a is the smallest number."")elif c < b < a: print(c is the smallest number."")else: print(b is the smallest number."")```",1
your code doesn't do what you think it does,0
wdym?,0
try with `9` `9` `10000000`,0
k,0
wudnt input be str so the comparision will fail?,0
^,0
it works just fine,0
so `1000000` is the smallest number ?,0
no,0
its 9,0
then you are using python2,0
switch to python3,0
nope,0
yes,0
python 3.8.6,0
wdym?,0
@lgneous ?,0
@Deleted User right it's because there's another logic error in your code,0
try with `1000000` `9` `8`,0
Woah i didnt know```python>>> 2'<'4'True>>> 2'>'4'False```How does string comparions work actually?,0
lexicographically,0
means?,0
it uses raw utf values for ordering iterating through both strings it stops at the first non equal pair of character moves to the next one if they're equal,1
so that `'a < b'` and `'aa > a'`,0
OOh,0
@lgneous woaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,0
how do i fix this dude,0
you have to change the `a < b < c`,0
"and you have to add something after `a = input(""blabla"")`",0
@lgneous How will u get the raw utf value?,0
`ord(c)`,0
Oh ok,0
it doesn't have to be some utf encoding btw it's just utf8 is the most common,0
"> and you have to add something after `a = input(""blabla"")`@lgneous ummm can you pls elaborate?",0
`input` returns a string,0
"`""10000000 < 9""`",0
Hey @asdfqwerty!,0
i just said how,0
so should i do `int(a) < int(b) < int(c)`?,0
@lgneous a and b'a have same ord then why isnt < supported between instances of str and bytes,0
then?,0
that'd work @Deleted User,0
yes you can ?,0
idk you tell me,0
"`int(""30"")`",0
welcome to the club,0
Hi nach,0
don't use `is not`,0
it's not the same,0
because `is not` is not `!=`,0
`is [not]` checks for referential equality it checks if the 2 operands you are comparing refer to the same object,0
so that if you modify one it modifies the other,0
,0
is not checks for if 2 objects are the exact same,0
identity check,0
!= checks for equality,0
@lgneous i think this would work..,0
@Vivs,0
"```pya = input(""Enter your first number: )b = input(""Enter your second number: )c = input(""Enter your third number: )if int(c) > int(a) < int(b) : print(a is the smallest number."")elif int(c) > int(b) < int(a): print(b is the smallest number."")else: print(c is the smallest number."")```",1
yup,0
looks good yes,0
very good,0
thnx,0
assuming you only want to work with integers of course,0
`int`s are a special case @Vivs,0

,0
i just need an quick help on how to download an .png from website,0
no,0
@iiDev_Waffle did it work?,0
like there's a pool of integer objects between 5 and 256,0

instead of creating a new object,0

i have decompiled the pyinstaller exe but i need a decompiler for pyc,0
what the fu x2,0
so.. can i replace stuff in a file like a line or do i have to just.. copy the file and re write to it with the changes i need to make?,1

pyc files are not machine code if that's what you meant,0
@Akarys that is nice i'll google it thankssss,0
so basically i can open the file in write/append mode use .seek and only replace that part huh,0

hello,0
if you don't use the decorator it's a regular method,0
> @Inheritance ♦ > where and what does it do@Deleted User it makes it so that the bot does not send more than one message,1
in fact it's always a regular method the decorator just catch the `self` parameter (the first parameter really) and doesn't pass it to the function,1
@Akarys i google .seek() and it talks about pointing to certain parts of the file or something i am not sure how to apply this to swap stuff in a file,1
okay..,0
and where to put?,0
depends on your code,0
in this case swap a password with a new one (both are hashed yes),0
> @zeeshanok `self` is a reference to the object you called the method on. For instance if I call `my_object.my_method()` Ill get `my_object` as `self`@Akarys But it doesn't care if it's self right ? just the first param right?,1
Anyone got any good coding challenges for intermediate python knowledge?,0
well.. if you don't use self then you should make it a @Deleted Usermethod,0
> self is just an automatic representative thing that gets a pointer to the object you called it in@NotNominal even if i decide to name the first param something other than self.. it will still work right?,1
methods never belong to the instance itself,0
a file format? like .txt or different stuff? ughh so i have to use something else other than that,0
we don't duplicate methods for every instances,0
that'd be outrageous,0
i'm storing the hashed passwords in plain text in a .txt file and maybe that's a bad idea,0
i should probably look for something better,0
yeah,0
> we don't duplicate methods for every instances@lgneous is there a way to do that ?,0
go crazy and try to use sqlite or mongo,0
yes `self.x = lambda ...`,0
in the constructor for example,0
why,0
(don't do that),0
why would you ever need that,0
self gets the current instance,0
`self` isn't the name of the class,0
it isn't,0
it's the current instance there's no other way to access it,0

A program is needed for a quiz to help younger students to practise their multiplication tables.

Thereis no scoring.A student can choose which multiplication table from 2 to 12 to use for the quiz. There are fivequestions in each quiz each question must use the chosen multiplication table and a different wholenumber (from 1 to 12) as the multiplier.Write and test a program or programs for a multiplication tables quiz.• Your program or programs must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data; data must bevalidated on entry.• Error messages and other output need to be set out clearly and understandably.• All variables constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names.You will need to complete these three tasks.

newb question I'm sure. I have a function I'm calling that consumes strings. A lot of the arguments get passed in with formatters like `'%.4f MHz % freq`.

``[::3] /= 2``,0
@PvPBoost because PIL lets you use numpy to manipulate raw pixel data,0
`np.asarray` gets the content of the image into a numpy array which you should learn if you want to use numpy,1
`[::3]` gets the alpha channel which we divide by 2,0

What you can do is get both alpha channels normalize them between 0 to 1 then multiply the rgb channels by that normalized alpha then add the 2 images together,1
no,0

did u import discord?,0
I mean licensing is supplemental to any code but mostly this channel is for asking python language/use questions,0
yeah,0
Licensing kinda falls out of that category,0
import discordfrom discord.ext import commands,0
yeah ^^^^],0
Btw if you want to merge 2 rgb images you don't have to manipulate the alpha channel yourself you can use Image.blend,1
that should work for the person that had a problem with the commands not working,0
`from discord.ext import commands`,0
Yeah looks right to me,0
still error f,0
well how do they get your code @Invito,0
@Invito in theory yes. In practice it's rarely that simple. And most of what stops people from doing this is not the practical side of it but the threat of being sued and hauled into court.,1

that's what i've been saying for ever lol,0
so how can they get your code and remove that @Invito,0
not sure what you mean by execute code on the server side,0
We get people asking about this sort of thing often. If you don't want people to try and reverse engineer your program don't give it to them as a binary. Make it available as SaaS from a site and they'll never be able to make use of it without paying you for it.,1
!ot @Kamil,0
,0
@Invito well if you give them the code you can make them sign an agreement that prohibits reverse engineering etc. But if you're charging money for something like this it makes sense to invest some of that money in hosting infrastructure and offer it as SaaS to guarantee your own customers can't fleece you.,1

@Invito that sounds like your next line of research. If you're serious about this do the homework,0
so im getting no answer k then,0
not when you act like you're 2 @Deleted User,0
people it will be far more productive for you to get a help channel if you're getting talked over in here.,1
@Ritik Raj there's tools like PyArmor that provide some protection against this. But on the whole you have to accept that any program you put into someone's hands can be reverse engineered if they have access to the running binary,1
and as LightSpd said not everyone cares enough to bother.,0

> No one really wants to get it.@LightSpdRunnerNothing sweeter than the cold hard truth,0
@Deleted User I guess nobody wants to help me ok then. What type of statement is that are we supposed to feel sorry for you now,1
@Ritik Raj there's degrees of security. You can obfuscate source which will stop most people from bothering. But if you want to completely prevent it you can't really do that short of offering things as SaaS,1

so,0
when can you not cancel a variable,0
(h^2+7h)/h= h+7 for example,0
but I remember my teacher saying something like you can't cancel it if it's 0,0
but I dont remember when it applies,0
obviously it doesnt apply in this one but,0
well cancel one h from each term or divide each term by h or whatever u wanna say,0
why cant you?,0
but holdup,0
there are no solutions to that,0
jk im dumb,0
yeah 2 and 0,0
but why cant you divide by 0,0

you say list.append('element'),0

use regex maybe,0

Anybody use scrapy?,0
Maybe but it's just a set up question,0
@Slow In my experience every problem requires its own solution you tend to just pick up skills as you go and remember very little in terms of code blocks,1
Once you've done a few scripts you tend to go to ones for reference,0
Like I have a script where I've used Requests a lot but I barely remember much requests code directly so I reference the previous script when I need to use it,1
@YousefGamer take it to offtopic andwherever you go stop spamming channels with the same question repeatedly,0
There are just too many libraries to remember all in one go,0
@Slow yes it helps to keep previous projects as references for how you did particular things.,0

but doing like this not work either,0
oh wait,0
@Deleted User I think you are confusing `if/else` with `try/except` for this kind of conditional check.,0
I forgot print lol,0
when you say `if condition:` it's `condition` that must be true not whatever happens in the following block.,0
"```import pikepdfprint(""Enter PDF file or / and directory to unlock!"")if True: pdf = pikepdf.open(input(),password=\'user257\') pdf.save(\'book_without_pass.pdf\') print(""PDF File Unlocked!"")if False:  pdf = pikepdf.open(input(),password=\'user257\') print(""File invalid!"")```",1
anyone know how to make this work? i need it now turn into a exe,0
`if True:` is not the kind of condition you want here.,0
and inside that Function folder theres another 3 file,0
"```pyimport pikepdfprint(""Enter PDF file or / and directory to unlock!"")try: pdf = pikepdf.open(input(),password=\'user257\')except Exception: print(""File invalid!"")else: pdf.save(\'book_without_pass.pdf\') print(""PDF File Unlocked!"")```",0
That's assuming `.open()` throws an exception if the password is invalid,0
thanks!,0
now how to compile python to exe lol,0
i use `i` instinctively for things i need to repeat instead of `_`,0
It helps to use a loop variable that is descriptive. `for letter in string_of_letters:`,0
`for color in colors` tells you a lot more than `for i in lst`,0
sure for simple stuff it isn't so bad but it's a good habit to have anyway,0
It took me far too long to wean myself of the habit of undescriptive variables,0
anyone know how I use py2exe?,0
https://i.imgur.com/hNJn5xb.png uh how can i use the `response` variable inside the `c_custom_command` func?,0

oh,0
> Globals should be avoided@Jac_k im used to c# lol,0
i usually use `i` for that just by habit,0
> Globals in C# are also bad.@LightSpdRunner actually for one makes code more readable it makes more sense to use globals and its actually very useful in most situations in c#,1
so I do setup.py for py2exe,0

> https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/148108/whyisglobalstatesoevil @Deleted User this applies to globals but any kind of mutability and other side effects noq@lgneous it actually just depends on how u use globals tbh,1
Yes that's true,0
the usual reason you would use globals is to avoid passing things into functions though,0
The correct method being to not use them,0
@marc ok thank you,0
just learn to X is generally a terrible argument against everything there are legitimate reasons why a mutable global state (in particular) is bad a dozen or so are mentioned in that post now you\'re free to ignore that of course,1
how do i open a file if its in another folder in the same main folder?,0
> the usual reason you would use globals is to avoid passing things into functions though@✪ SavagePastaMan i dont do that a lot i only really ever used used globals in c# for readonly purposes since i dont want to be writing the same piece of string or boolean or smth in every single function that would also be pretty hard to update if u decided to change something its why globals are useful theyre a single variable which u can change and everything else using that global will use the changed value,1
but they're constants that's fine,0
variables vary,0
The issue isn't the global part it's the mix of global + mutable state,0
right hard coding values into different spots is sure to lead to bugs,0
> The issue isn't the global part it's the mix of global + mutable state@lgneous yeah but again it depends on how u use these kind of globals,1
Nope it's almost without exaggeration always universally bad,0
ok ure telling me while im running my code if i wanna change a global that can hurt my program? :lol:,1
there's no reason you can't pass state instead of using a global state,0
Introducing a global variable in the codebase means not passing code review where I work and that's the only redeeming thing I can say about our codebase and workflow,1
Just read the link I posted,0
check the count,0
Tldr it's impossible to track what's going on,0

i know like u know theres auto py to exe i wonder if theres such thing is py to jar,0
happens year round,0
> Tldr it's impossible to track what's going on@lgneous again it depends on how u use them if ure gonna make a 20mb program and gonna debug it every single time u run it ure most likely going to run into problems but making small shit that wont be messy and big wont lead to much problems,1
I mean OK your 20 lines script is fine with globals but it wouldn't cost you anything to define them as parameters either,1
depends on...pretty much everything @kendalk08,0

> I mean OK your 20 lines script is fine with globals but it wouldn't cost you anything to define them as parameters either@lgneous except if i use the same e.g. string in any and every of my functions that would definetely lead to bugs + u can change globals while ur program is running,1
huh?,0
I'm done arguing with someone that doesn't want to try to understand teh opposite point of view hf with your bugs,1
global constants very good global variables are very bad,0
wait what is transpiler mean?,0
So i just remembered somethingI can't do```pyif [x y z] in text: pass```since that requires a string as the left hand operand...so what can i do?,1
@LightSpdRunner read Dijkstra mail to the Texas university on them replacing Haskell with Java in the curriculum,0
I think it was a university in Texas not sure actually,0
HOW DO I OPEN FILES FROM FOLDERS?,0
you would have to loop over the list,0
caps oops,0
If you Google Dijkstra Java bad Haskell good you\'ll find it I guess,0
Fair,0
> global constants very good global variables are very bad@✪ SavagePastaMan why are they bad? as ive said before if ure gonna make a fucking 20mb program ofc ure gonna have some fucking problems im talking small here tho how tf can global vars affect someone if they can actually inspect and debug their whole code in like 30 min in a 50kb program or smth,1
oh,0
i don't think you know how large 50kb is but the point stands global variables are pretty much never good,0
so its like rewrite the code into another language,0
> i don't think you know how large 50kb is but the point stands global variables are pretty much never good@✪ SavagePastaMan ive made 50kb before lol its not that large,1
the possibility of introducing bugs is always there when you could just pass the state like normal,0
pass it to every function? doesnt seem normal to me,0
his argument isn\'t really against java and for haskell but rather about the idea that computer scientists should be (in his views) taught how to do proper computer science and that not facing students with newer FP concepts is just limiting them to what they know making them scared of new concepts,1
hmm i dont think exe would work on mac right?,0
sadly he lost and he's no longer there to scream about imperative programming,0
https://chrisdone.com/posts/dijkstrahaskelljava/ (that was in 2001),0
if you need to pass it to every function you should consider using oop,0
> @Deleted User why are you passing a single variable to every function in 50kbs of code? that doesnt make much sense@kendalk08 thats what i said :lol:,1
because i have a project that i wanted to be able to run on both windows and mac,0
without installing python and libararys,0
> if you need to pass it to every function you should consider using oop@✪ SavagePastaMan or using a global variable how tf can it affect anything srsly now if i wanna change something GLOBALLY like a string or some shit in the whole program while its running i change the global var,1
then your state is unpredictable,0
so what type of executables does mac uses?,0
why would they even exist in c# py etc. if theyre bad? heck its impossible to avoid it in any program almost,1
MachO @! xXKiller_BOSSXx,0
> then your state is unpredictable@✪ SavagePastaMan could be depending on ur code,0
again if you're not willing to learn no need to argue @Deleted User,0
did you read the post i linked like 30 minutes ago,0
the link has a great answer in it,0
hmm then is there py to machO thing?,0
> did you read the post i linked like 30 minutes ago@lgneous yes its mostly bad for debugging and testing (which was not my main point about globals),1
@kendalk08 look up ML,0
the metalanguage kind not machine learning,0
in ML every function take exactly one parameter,0
and it's completely fine,0
> @Deleted User no im saying. what program would require you to use a single variable in every function? seems odd to do that@kendalk08 not every lol but like lets say 30 functions or smth,1
(i know it's not what you meant just wanted to bikeshed),0
> Bugs from mutable global state  a lot of tricky bugs are caused by mutability. Bugs that can be caused by mutation from anywhere in the program are even tricker as it's often hard to track down the exact cause@Deleted User you kinda forgot the most important point,1
> @Deleted User you kinda forgot the most important point@lgneous what bugs? LOL,0
as its often hard to track down the exact cause which is what i said again debugging and testing,0
you are underestimating how hard it gets,0
if u change a global var and ur program fails cuz something happened somewhere and u cant track it down thats a debugging/testing issue,1
what about you just don't use global states and you already know where the variable comes from,0
the issues happen when you don't know the global variables are changing,0
> what about you just don't use global states and you already know where the variable comes from@lgneous and what if i need tho change that variable while my program is running :lol: thats my main point how the actual fuck do u change a function param while ur program is running wtf,1
you pass a parameter,0
like there are decades of programming history behind you and you're ignoring it,0
`x = change_value(x)`,0
there are languages where mutating variables is near impossible and they do completely fine,0
> `x = change_value(x)`@✪ SavagePastaMan ok yeah can do that lets do it in 30 functions then :D,0
yes let's,0
there are other ways to avoid code duplication,0
dont u see my main point? readablity,0
🤔 well yes,0
it's not less readable,0
if u add 30 lines of code when u can squeeze it to 1,0
how tf is that readability to u 30 new lines of code,0
you are squeezing it into 1 by breaking the logical flow of your program,0
lines of code is not a metric for code readability,0
honestly dude if you want to keep thinking global state is good have fun,0
@JeeveStobs Well `your cost of food + your cost of shelter + your cost of transit` 😄,0
@Deleted User Can you show your code?,0
> lines of code is not a metric for code readability@lgneous code readability is defined by a person not by a language,1
yes and most people don't think shorter code is always more readable,0
otherwise we'd all be using APL,0
yet here we are java is one of the most common programming language on the planet,0
> @Deleted User Can you show your code?@fix error i was just giving examples tho lol i wanted some help for some for loop and ppl told me not to use globals then this shit started etc.,1
> yes and most people don't think shorter code is always more readable@lgneous some yes,0
i do though,0
well let me present you to the #esotericpython challenges,0
then i think you need to read more code,0
> then i think you need to read more code@lgneous or i think u need to understand code. readability. is. defined. by. a. person.,1
I was about to say what savage pasta man said,0
"```pyfor i in range(100):print(i%3//2""Fizz""+i%5//4""Buzz""or~i)```is this better than a normal fizzbuzz?",0
it's less lines no?,0
u cant change how i read my code,0
> it's less lines no?@✪ SavagePastaMan yes but that looks ugly its not readable XD,0
"@fucdapols when you submit an expression like `1>2` in the Python command line (or REPL"") it returns a result immediately. If you have that as a line in a script it does nothing because scripts don\'t work like that.",1

again you do you my guy nobody is going to hunt you for using globals,0
but when ure literally copy pasting a line of code 30 times in ur program that affects my readablity,0
code reviews will be there to prevent that code from ever entering a big project tho (hopefully),0

@Deleted User Well if you want to contribute to an open source project that's a good issue 🙂,0
meh im not that type of guy,0
anyway my point was i'd rather use global vars than copy pasting the same line of code in 15 different functions which downright looks ugly and adds more useless lines of code,1
why do `param = changed_value` in every function when u can make a global var and only have to change that? yes debugging/testing but thats not an issue in smallish projects,1
@Deleted User Some of them are beginners and still learning the language so whether you like it or don't like it keep that to yourself sir and don't give negative opinion about someone else's code,1

and theres always one thing to remember: theres always an UPSIDE to something but a DOWNSIDE as well,0
Is there any way to update a global variable inside a local function that takes that variable as its parameter?```pydef newnum(number): number += 5n1 = 3newnum(n1)print(n1)```,1
how do i get to the discord.py repo,0
sure good practices are good but the downside is more repeated code which is what most should avoid,0
global <var> doesnt seem to work,0
@Deleted User No that's not really possible in Python (as most thing it is but that's a big hack). You can do this though:```pydef newnum(number): return number + 5x = 3x = newnum(x)```,1
> @Deleted User I did that and trust me it doesn't look good. One thing you can do is use `ctypes` pointers maybe@appling ill look for resources (:,1
well with global variables the upside is so unbelievably small it's not worth it pretty much ever,0
> @Deleted User No that's not really possible in Python (as most thing it is but that's a big hack). You can do this though:> ```py> def newnum(number):> return number + 5> > x = 3> x = newnum(x)> ```@fix error oh rip,1
@Deleted User It\'s not that much longer  and it\'s easier to test this function (not necessarily in a test even in the REPL),1
> @Deleted User Hold up let me try to recreate what I did before@appling sure o:,0
@brit ◡̈ Sure Instragram was originally written in Python if I recall correctly. Although the frontend stuff will have to be written in JavaScript or a language that compiles to JS (TypeScript Elm PureScript ReasonML etc.),1
@appling uh... welcome to #esotericpython,0
How can I add +1 to a global variable when a function is using that variable?,0
@brit ◡̈ Because Python doesn't run in the browser (you can do it with Brython but it's kind of esoteric),0
> ```py> some_var = 10> > def check(global_var):> if global_var % 2 == 0:> globals()[[n for n v in globals().items() if v == global_var][0]] = 0> > print(some_var)> check(some_var)> print(some_var)> > ```@appling woah I'll try it,1
@brit ◡̈ You can make GUIs with Python.,0
@brit ◡̈ JavaScript is the only realistic choice for anything in the browser right now.,0
@brit ◡̈ ...although you might have an issue with licensing if you want to make the app closedsource,0
It's entirely possible to keep your commitment to JS minimal but you need at least some of it on the front end for certain kinds of interactivity.,1
@Infinimata they said they didn't want it to run in browser,0
where will it run then?,0
what kind of app?,0
The discord app is basically a web browser in a container.,0
@brit ◡̈ You can totally make a desktop app in Python (Thonny is an example). There are many GUI libraries for Python. Although as I said you might have an issue with licensing if you want to make the app closedsource.,1
@brit ◡̈ A program is closed source'/'shareware if you ship it as an executable don't share its source code with others (as opposed to open source).,1
Don't release the source code.,0
And attach a license that makes it clear you can't do that.,0
> @Deleted User Do you understand what the code does? The `[n for n v in globals().items() if v == global_var]` just goes through `globals()` since it's a dict and then sees if the value of the variable is equal to the value of the variable you passed in. It selects the first one and then sets it to 0@appling I kinda did but I got it now thanks (:,1
is there any simple way to filter a string?,0
"> You are assuming a false dichotomy here. You think explicitly passing variables makes code unreadable. You haven\'t seen examples of variable passing done right.@Darr ```csprivate void DoSomething(string something){ // doing some shit here with the parameter of this function}```now imagine this function but 15 more times (just an e.g) each with different names and code etc. BUT with the same param ofc now would u rather do `something = someotherstring""` instead of just making a global var? ure going to say yes and while its good practice as u said ure literally going to have to do that to EACH of the functions if u wanna change that parameter not to mention and thats going to be HELLLLL literal HELL to use and not to mention u cant change what u passed to the function while the program is running like `DoSomething(""yeah"");` how are u going to change that string OUTSIDE of the `DoSomething` function? huh? u\'ll need to pass a variable instead but then hey guess what GLOBAL VARS lol dont u see u\'ll eventually run into problems like this? not everyone will but it just really depends on what ur code is and does this is what i mean global vars arent necessarily a bad thing if u need to use them or if u feel like using them because it\'ll make the code harder to read or maintain or stuff like that but yeah its good practice to do what u said but u\'ll most likely just going to run into global vars EVENTUALLY theyre impossible to avoid (unless ure doing something like hello world lol)",1
@Deleted User I hope you don't take that kind of code seriously  it's just a big hack 👀,0
... well that was quite a post,0
like i've got this now:```pyfiltered_words = ['bad words here']your_string = input('Enter a sentence: )string_split = your_string.split()for c in filtered_words: if c in string_split: string_split.remove(c)final_result = for c in string_split: final_result += f'{c} print(final_result)```,1
> @Deleted User I hope you don't take that kind of code seriously  it's just a big hack 👀@fix error I hope so xd,1
@Deleted User If you have a bunch of functions that operate on some common state you can put that state as instance variables of an object (or use a higher order function).,1
no they really are very easy to avoid,0
> no they really are very easy to avoid@✪ SavagePastaMan in c# impossible to avoid u'll eventually in ur code need them,1
> @Deleted User when faced with that scenario you'd do something better. That's calling for classes or higher order functions@Darr ok well guess what no one mentioned that before in here :lol:,1
@Deleted User Have you heard of _dependency injection_?,0
sure global variables do seem like a good alternative to what you described but the best thing is to make sure you don't get into a scenario like you described by planning your project and using something like object oriented programming,1
@fix error yeah but i havent looked into it,0
several people mentioned that there are other constructs for avoiding code duplication,0
> in c# impossible to avoid u'll eventually in ur code need them@Deleted User you can always avoid them,0
it's even mentioned in that stackexchange post,0
> @Deleted User you can always avoid them@✪ SavagePastaMan never in c#,0
go ask multiple c# main devs,0
you're making false dilemmas (global state vs redundant code) up and ignoring our counterpoints,0
yes you can avoid global state in c# ...,0
c# is no different than any other language in that regard,0
why are we talking about c# in the python server,0
> yes you can avoid global state in c# ...@lgneous avoid it completely no sure in 99% in ur code u can but that 1% will be occupied by a global var at some point,1

no that's the only error i have i debugged it throughouly i'm just making a small change for a specific thing i'm doing,1
then paste your entire code,0
@Typho ```pydef send(self msg: str crypt=True conn=self.conn):```Here you're trying to access `self` when `self` is not defined yet. In Python default arguments are evaluated when the function is defined not every time you call it....like with mutable default arguments:```pydef f(x=[]): x.append(1) print(x)f() # [1]f() # [1 1]f() # [1 1 1]```,1
in this case instead of only sending to self.conn i have the optional parameter so that i can also send to other connections,1
ah,0
yikes that is NOT good,0
(also yes i did tell you the whole 230 lines of the code that has nothing to do with that weren't relevant),1
@Typho You can set the default to `None` and then check if it's `None` in the method body.,0
yeah that's what i was thinking of doing,0
i see we're synced ahah,0
that's why i said that i coulda taken a more complicated way earlier,0
note that if you use `None` for some other signaling you can create a custom singleton object and use that instead.,1
yes ok you lost me with that one,0
oh sorry  sometimes people use `None` as a value to be passed along that isn't a placeholder default.,0
So they have to come up with some other default that isn't used and a `class` object that's only used for that is one way to do it,1

@kendalk08 What string are you running `eval` on? And why are you using `eval`?,0
hmm.. so the reason i needed to add that optional connection parameter earlier is that with me creating a new instance of the server class for every connection i get i need to be able to send data to other instance's connections so i just store them in a list and try to pull instance.conn (since i save it as self.conn) but for some reason it doesnt work.. like the code works as usual and client server talk it gets around to sending the message to other connections but the client doesnt seem to receive it??,1

@Hoopefully bruh,0
its referring to something that you shouldn't do,0
whereispythonsharedlibraryonwindows,0
^,0
but they also want to show that instance methods aren\'t magic,0
they're just normal funcs with `self` passed as the first arg,0
wat is args (legit question),0
for python how do i make a string equal an input like thisx = input(),0
I input:,0
the following,0
12334343441,0
it will only make x = 12334,0
and not ''12334343441,0
like if you use ctrl c and then ctrl v,0
it won't read the 2nd line even with ctrl v,0
I just want it to read the second line,0
oh,0
`sys.stdin.read()` will get you the entire input,0
but you have to do CtrlD on a empty line after you finish entering it,0
oh,0
do any of you guys do USACO,0
or whatever the windows EOF key is,0
doesn't usaco read from a file?,0
usaco gives input as `problemname.in`,0
need more description,0
whats the question?,0
i need some help can anyone privately message and hlep or no?,0
bruh,0
what is it supposed to do,0
sum all multiples of 3 and 5 below a number?,0
ok,0
you have an infinite loop,0
because number is never going to change if it doesn't start as a mult of 3 or 5,0
ok,0
if number is 7 what does your code do,0
bruh semicolons?,0
@bott your code is dupe summing on mults of 3 and 5,0
triple summing,0

@bott please remove the `;`s before anybody sees them 😄,0
👀,0
I don't know why `;`s are still in Python  probably for backward compatibility,0
> maybe backend/fullstack dev? depends on your skills outside of python as well@Fisher who for though,0
brug.,0
compared to what?,0
Python's procedural approach? 👀,0
well JS and Python are languages with very different philosophies,0
Not sure what you mean by procedural approach  JS and Python are both imperative objectoriented languages with some support for ideas from functional programming,1
Does anyone know why Terminal on Mac asks me to allow for it to open a specific folder every so often when I try and run my program? I'm assuming it's for security,1
@Fisher I’m currently learning Django I just really need to make money but I’m just not good enough to work for someone yet so it’s kind of frustrating (I’m a teen btw),1
Alright :) @Fisher Thanks!,0
> What folder?@Bast I forgot exactly which ones but twice it temporarily stopped and only continued after I clicked allow,0
Yeah I still have some time only 15,0
> IIRC it's because OSX protects apps from accessing user folders now unless it's got a good reason to@Bast Would it make sense to allow for full disk access? That way I can let my program run in the background without tinkering with it,1
@bott Well saying that Python or JS are functional languages or that they support functional programming very well is a big stretch. But some things like first class functions higherorder functions lambdas pattern matching list comprehensions delegating to a subgenerator and `async/await` iterators are good functional ideas present in both languages to some extent (except comprehensions in JS; and object/dict pattern matching in Python) and you should try them.,1
> but generally when you're at the point of using the terminal that's something you had assumed was the case@Bast Right so if im developing an application I SHOULD give the Terminal Full Disk Access correct?,1
> yes@Bast Thanks!,0
of course,0
always has been,0
~~or Idris~~,0
> When you finally bundle up your application to distribute it (if you do) you'll learn about plist files where you can request specific permissions. Terminal is special because it's so flexible that you'd need to give it more.@Bast Hmmm does that have anything to do with deploying on GitHub?,1

should i start learning c with only python knowledge or should i learn something else first,0
also need an opinion i just started learning phython a week ago and most of my friends suggest i switch to java should i make the switch,1
@Deleted User why did they say you should switch to java?,0
Java is a bad learning language because it's too strict,0

@nOVa no that will be fine,0
thanks,0
"@kendalk08 why is your dict called user_list""?",0
that could be a way to append to a list but not a dict,0
@kendalk08 if it's a dict then .append won't work,0
maybe you want: `user_list[name] = priv`?,0
then it sounds like my code is right?,0
no you can just assign the key like i showed,0
should i upgrade to py 3.9? im on 3.8.5,0
3.8 is fine,0
ah okay. when do you usually upgrade @nedbat,0
@Ovicron when i want a new feature or when the version is too old to stay supported,0
if you want to use 3.9 that's fine too,0
@nedbat ah got it thanks,0
@Arisu both,0
they do different things,0
mypy checks your type declarations. pylint checks lots of things,0
_blushes_,0
i'm sure you can run both in VSCode,0
(though I don't know how),0
@Arisu then run them outside of vscode,0
does anyone possibly know how to use bot commands in a bot's dms?,0
you don't need global unless you are assigning to the name,0

how to get whats on terminal right now?,0
sorry not sure what you mean,0
unexpected indent probably,0
Hi does anybody know what language google was made in?,0

@acua_11 you can't stop a thread from outside the thread,0
what do your threads do?,0
why does project euler love number theory so much https://projecteuler.net/problem=728,0
it's more about math than programming,0
I mean I see no problems in homotopy algebraic geometry or even general pointset topology,0
not that homotopy has nice applications to make a textbased problem but you get the idea,0
? What the hell?,0
Where did I state otherwise?,0
I'm talking about the type of math that's in there,0
There are more math topics beyond number theory,0
numbers are easy to work with.,0
Occasionally there are some geometry problems,0
we don't know why PE is the way it is 🙂,0
giga obvious,0
@acua_11 you need to send a message to the thread telling it to quit. Do you have a queue to communicate with the thread?,1
@Deleted User sorry we disappointed you....,0
what,0
You could\'ve just said idk @Mr. Hemlock,0
@Deleted User i thought you were saying that the things we said were obvious,0
The thing hemlock said was obvious not you @nedbat,0
Like if it's that obvious just don't bother replying,0
@Deleted User pinging people can help clarify. got it.,0
I need a good voxel engine to export tensors which interfaces well with Python. Anyone have any ideas?,0
@acua_11 are you sure you need threads? They can be complicated.,0
why do you need them?,0
@Mr. Hemlock I mean there aren't either any physics problems in there.I think Euler's name is in there for the aesthetics not anything to do with him,1
@j\ You forgot,0
@D. 🔮 can you share your code?,0
@Mr. Hemlock Nah apparently the influnce came from a math olympiad forum that's kind of like modern competitive programming websites,0
@acua_11 how can we help? If you tell us more maybe we can get you unstuck,0
,0
@acua_11 https://www.amazon.com/StructuredParallelProgrammingEfficientComputation/dp/0124159931,0
@Mr. Hemlock Well it's an entire area of study I'd recommend learning it or infinite struggle but yeah it's not gonna help him shortterm,1
@kendalk08 just open and close it with write,0
I know cause I've made this mistake many times,0
open('a.csv w').close(),0
boom all contents gone,0
well then just take an input from user,0
and ask to clear file,0
but i'm sure there isn't a clear function,0
@Mr. Hemlock 👍,0
What is the difference b/w ```  __init__.py Models.py View.py Base.py``` And```  Models.py View.py Base.py```,0
> The latter uses a namespace package@PureFunctor And that means ?,0
"@kendalk08 Well why do you have to read it first?That's the issue here,`open('a.txt w').close`Does clear the thing. But your problem is that you have to read it why?Maybe do a function that takes file as input then reads it and asks if you want to clear the file?",1
Or simply just read the file and then do the clear after regardless?,0
Project would be the way to go,0
@kendalk08 I don't understand,0
the code in __init.py__ run during the import ?,0
You can append,0
🤔,0
If your a beginner at python and learn the basics what would you recommend coding first?,0
can i have stuff like `__str__.py` in there and will that work ?,0
What does that mean?,0
Ehhhh,0
@Deleted User mathematics 🤗,0
@Deleted User wdym?,0
I don't have a use case now.. just trying to understand how stuff work @foo(),0
What do you mean mathematics,0
@kendalk08 Ohh why not just use log?,0
will that file run when i say print(module) ?,0
and what does `__main__.py` do ?,0
What’s the opposite of a If statement,0
module object inherits from object right ?,0
Yeah^^,0
what is the difference between `__new__` and `__init__` dunders ?,0
uh anyone here knows how to make your ai search things on google. I made my ai search in wikipedia but i have no idea how to make it search in google,1
@Deleted User ahh math as in graph theory logic probability combinatorics are cool,0
> @Kronos `__new__` creates the new object (or technically it can also return an existing one). `__init__` initializes newly created objects.@godlygeek can you link me to somthing that shows how the code inside `__new__` would look like ? i haven't seen anyone overriding `__new__`,1
@Phaedra Leonidas just looking at the error and trying to figure out what the cause is,0

and who decides that? @<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël],0
what would the default `__new__` look like ?,0
> @Kronos It's implemented in C so it's a bit tricky to explain@PureFunctor Okay.. But in the Path example you shared i couldn't find a call to the default `__new__`  so does that mean the c stuff is not run in that case ?,1

@NTBBloodbath the zen of python part on one way of doing things has been out of the question for decades already but it\'s a good ideal to pursue seeing code and knowing what it does directly without letting any options to argue about how we should do thing is a great way to stay productive in the face of the need to argue programmers have,1
@...aaaa you can also do checking for even and odd numbers from a user input,0
@NTBBloodbath lol,0
it's not lol,0
It certainly is a lot more than beginners think,0
in 17 hours many bots are gonna be gone,0
It might be hard for some ppl,0

i hope,0
And one day you will try some other language and realize what you could do with programming and hate every other language with a burning passion making your professional life hell as you know these tools will never be used in the industry,1

Ahhh thanks,0

what is this ?,0
It actually executes perfectly,0
> now I must reverse engineer your code to understand it@Fisher you could always read the interpreter code. While it’s not that good (more of a quick hack) it’s still logical,1
Oh no,0
Or wait we could have a programming language competition between us,0
> im making a discord bot for among us@sourlemon what a coincidence,0
I did that this morning,0
We both completely new ones and then let some jury decide who wins,0
We could force all mods+ to judge it :hyperlemon:,0
,0
@Fisher or we could set together a small jury before starting and maybe let others join as participants as well,0
sorry,0
For sure,0
Lark parser?,0
Aah. Could be cool but limited,0
@sourlemon that would be interesting. We could have a “human text language”,0
Well even more like English,0
“Create the variable x and set the value to 5” would work as well as “set a new variable x to 5”,1
That would be really interesting,0
Yeahh. I think we could just arrange this ourselves as a fun little contest though,0
(Or we could make it an official small event),0
That is a must but making it an event for more people would be quite cool,0
@Fisher we could just start having a duel and then possibly arrange an event for more people where we (as new experts) could judge,1
Same. Let’s do it (for real). We’ll have to discuss the details later (class has started),0

Kinda UML is a formalized way to describe systems in flowcharts,0
There are better tools if you want uml specifically,0
Yeah kind of like that.,0
is UML still used in production  how is this done professionally ?,0
Like plantuml,0
In my experience no flowcharts to describe an overview of large projects definitely are UMLlike or not but going all the way up to describing every class inheritance and stuff isn't done,1
Learning compiler theory was the biggest step up in my learning process,0
This’ll be fun,0
In UML we define every minute aspect ?,0
You describe every compenent of the system along with their relationships up to the user interface,0
#❔｜howtogethelp,0
Crafting interpreters really holds your hand throughout the entire process dw about it,0
Is it hard to learn ? and what is difference if we do the same with a mind map tool. describe componets and their interactions. ? I saw references to UML in software engineering materials,1
Meh depends,0
The main difference is tree evaluation > codegen,0
And if you're targeting a high level language it's actually easier,0

Sure. Feel free to ask either here if it’s quicker or in a help channel (help channels are always fine to use). Check out #❔｜howtogethelp,1

if the token is in the object you can retrieve it,0

`isinstance(x typing.Iterable)`,0
the one who tells me whats wrong will get a free pull req to their github repo,0
lmao,0
or `typing.Mapping` iirc for,0
anyone tell me whats wrong pls,0
you are not supposed to expose the token nor the actual program to the end user,0
if you want to distribute your code you let them add their own token,0
you're not exactly supposed to let users do arbitrary evaluation,0
not in a nonsandboxed environment at least,0
`!e` is not just `eval`,0
idk how it's implemented exactly but it is surely running in a specific environment so that if someone runs malicious code it can just be wiped and restarted,1

ohh so `email` can be called as an attribute?,0
e.g. `thing.email` instead of `thing.email()`,0
This works best if the property in question never takes any arguments,0
if later on you find it has to take an argument you may have to rework things so use it judiciously,1

yes the idea is that you can call it without needing the parens basically. But again use it judiciously,0
i see so pproperty should be 1 lined?,0
it doesn't have to be it just needs to be something that will not take any arguments,0

i mean they are fine but not if they are trivial (such as in this case),0
what if you want to make sure you can't set an attribute to be above 10,0
They're not commonly used but they do come in handy,0
would you rather have to do ```pyobj.x = min(x 10)# everytime or just define that in the setter and doobj.x = x```,1

why should i be able to do `add(a=1 b=3)`,0
why not `add(x=1 y=3)`,0
or `add(lhs=1 rhs=3)`,0
@Inheritance ♦ what that does if I interpret this right is it's creating a property `age` that uses the `get_age set_age del_age` methods as its getter setter and deleter,1
ohhhh I think I kinda understand,0
@Slow huh?,0
hmm so is there something such as this ?```py@attribute_name.setter```OR```py@attribute_name.getter```OR```py@attribute_name.deleter```,0
@Inheritance ♦ the page I linked to has examples of how it works,0
iit does but do those things exist,0
!code,0
,0
`@property` is cool,0
i don't think anybody mentioned the actual benefit of `property`,0
in language that don't have them you have to code defensively around getters/setters,0
so your code ends up cluttered with `x.get_a()` everywhere,0
something like this ```pyclass Person(object): def __init__(self first_name last_name): self.first_name = first_name self.last_name = last_name @property def full_name(self): return self.first_name +   + self.last_name @full_name.setter def full_name(self value): first_name last_name = value.split( ) self.first_name = first_name self.last_name = last_name @full_name.deleter def full_name(self): del self.first_name del self.last_name```,1
`getter`?,0
`full_name` is the getter so you don't need to specify it,0
the real advantage of properties is that they use the same syntax as regular attribute access,0
ohh ok,0
can someone help me with this ```pythondef options(): print(f'{location}  {month} {day} {year}') print('Weather: +weather+ | Health: +health+ | Pace: +pace+ | Rations: +rations) print( ) print('1. Continue on Trail') print( ) choice = input('What is your choice? ) if choice == 1': day = day+1```,1
so you can code normally then later one if you see you need a getter/setter,0
why does the day = day+1 say unresolved reference,0
you don't have to go through the entire codebase to replace every `x.y` with `x.get_y()`,0
@Seascouter `day` has to be defined before you can manipulate it.,0
ok thanks,0
i dont think u can,0
you have to pop the elements and put them back in,0
but idk,0
@Hoopefully dicts don't have any inherent order though,0
they do in 3.7+,0
3.6 even if we're talking about cpython specifically,0
if you're talking about changing the insertion order which is retained then you'd need to create a new dict and insert the elements in the order you want,1
ah that changes things,0
oh then you'd need to traverse each key/value pair and create a new dict,0
@lgneous right I was leading up to that,0
@smol this being a Python server I'm not sure we can help you.,0
@smol what os are you on ?,0
`new_dict = {value:key for key value in old_dict.items()}` might work,0
where would we use `@property`  `getter` `setter` and `deleter`,0
when you want to make an attribute readonly or when you want to compute something everytime you access an attribute or when you want to add condition when you set an attribute etc,1
Encapsulation simply means when we create a new class object then all the attributes and methods available to said object are all neatly packaged?,1
ohhh ok I will try to use them when I have the option to,0
yeah not every feature HAS to be used,0
right,0
new username!,0
@Janis yes along with the idea of (dis)allowing access to the internals of your object to the user,0
wdym by the internals of the object,0
when you have a list `[]`,0
it has a bunch of stuff used internally to know its size the factor it grows at the number of element it can store etc,1
these don't need to be exposed to the outside,0
but they are required internally by the object to work,0
if you have some property in a class and you want any changes to that property to be made through methods instead of altering the property directly (because that could get messy) this is the way to do it,1
nope,0
> if you have some property in a class and you want any changes to that property to be made through methods instead of altering the property directly (because that could get messy) this is the way to do it@Infinimata ok I understand thank you!!!!!,1
very much,0
are you logging your application?,0
log it and see if what you think is happening is what actually happens,0
`getter setter and the delter `these are methods right?,0
`if not list:`,0
`if len(list) == 0`,0
if you could asnwer my question then pls pinng,0
yes they are methods of ``property`` objects,0
> yes they are methods of ``property`` objects@lgneous why do u consider `property` as an object,0
because it is an object,0
how is it an object?,0
sry for the stupid questions,0
python 3.9 ...,0
but like why and how do u consider what as an object,0
other than the fact that everything in python is an object,0
,0
oh ok,0
is any of your file named random?,0
Trry random.randint(val) (without space),0
ye,0
that does not change anything,0
when we call the deleter method the value of the attribute gets deleted then what is gonna be the value of the attribute after its deleted?,1
ohhh,0
ohh ok,0
any flaws with this```@property is a decorater that allows us to call a method as an attribute the getter setter and the delter are methods of the property object.the getter method gets the method as an attribute the setter mehtod sets the value of that attribute(method)the deleter method deletes the values of the attribute```,1
the notes as general,0
have i written something that is wrong in the terms of python,0
"All there is to it,the getter is for x.ythe setter is for x.y = zthe deleter is for del x.y",0
right i will add that as well thx a lot!,0
It calls the respective method based on which one you're doing,0
If you want the getter to delete stuff you can tho that's a dumb idea,0
ik i just wanted to have the notes forit,0
so that I can refer to it,0
Thank You!,0
what is this methdod for?```pydef __repr__()```,0
Yes you'll get 1 3 5 7,0
what does it do?,0
It's for returning an accurate representation of the object,0
Used by `repr`,0
i dont get it,0
Unlike `str` which returns a human readable string representation of the object,0
@lgneous could u give me an example,0
Someone just did,0
oh i did not see that,0
sorry for the ping in that case,0
It's ok I'm looking at the chat rn,0
```py>>> print(repr('abc'))'abc'>>> print('abc')abc```ohhh when the abc was printed it printed with `  `,0
let me try,0
it printed in this way```py>>> print(datetime.datetime.utcnow())20201007 15:41:48.165480>>> print(repr(datetime.datetime.utcnow()))datetime.datetime(2020 10 7 15 42 19 400760)```,0
just like u showed it,0
it printed the function call as well,0
so repr prints the function call basically?,0
right,0
but there wasn't a funciton call with the str though,0
what's that?,0
ohh wdym by `some` reprs how many reprs are there,0
@bee did u get demoted?,0
i thought u were a helper,0
ohh so there are many possibilites for a repr,0
ok sure,0
no indent wrong,0
Ok Thx a lot Guys !,0
yall really helped me,0
i appreciate it,0
~~need : on the else~~,0
"Why did I not get an output ```pyclass Employoee(): def __init__(self first last pay): self.first = first self.last = last self.pay = pay  @property def email(self): return f""{self.first}{self.last}@email.com"" @property def fullname(self): return f""{self.first} {self.last}  def __repr__(self): return f""Employee ({self.first} {self.last} {self.last})  me = Employoee(\'Abhigya\ \'Pokharel\ 5000)me.__repr__()```I get no output. Why is that?",1
,0
`format()` is stupid,0
but I am calling the `__repr__` function though,0
repr doesn't print it returns a string,0
ohh,0
oh ok,0
What,0
did they not say that repr does not give any output,0
It won't,0
His code works it just doesn't print,0
Just have to add print around the repr,0
@bee did u get demoted ?,0
sorry for the same question over again but just curious,0

what does __main__ == __name__ do?,0

thanks,0
oh ye @JagTheFriend u are right i forgot when I use the `@property` decorator i gotta call it as an attribute,1

@PureFrost seems like you're typing your code into the REPL not saving it into a file and executing that?,0
anyone here familiar with opencv?,0
also you never execute `main()` anywhere,0
@Luckayla i'm in code/help my question isn't that short,0

@SFM61319 You can make a method called `depth()` or you can make a `@property` named `depth`.,0
@SFM61319 That's exactly what `@property` is for,0
@SFM61319 ...if you don't make a setter for `@property` it's readonly.,0
if someone tries to set a `@property` with no setter it'll throw an exception,0
@JagTheFriend last time I tried something like that that's what I ended up with. I'm prepared to be proven wrong though,1
@kendalk08 you'd use the `json` module to convert dictionaries and lists to JSON format and back again,0

Hey @DARKEVIL!,0
How many functions do I need,0
efficient in what sense?,0
Hey @DARKEVIL!,0
@SFM61319 No. It's just that today you can do this:```pyclass Account: def __init__(self): self.balance_usd = 100```and tomorrow you can change it to this:```pyclass Account: def __init__(self): self._balance_usd = 100 @property def balance_usd(self): return self._balance_usd @property def balance_rubles(self): return self._balance_usd  78.19 @property def balance_pounds(self): return self._balance_usd  0.77```without breaking all the code that's using this class.,1
(we hope that the users are not making some spaghetti code and therefore don't mutate `Account.balance_usd`),0

@Mr Facilityy Put the input inside the while true cycle.,0
@SFM61319 second one,0
@SFM61319 which makes more sense for what you're doing `.degree` or `.getdegree()`?,0
It just prints incorrect because it will never change,0
No problem 👍,0
@SFM61319 Different libraries have vastly different philosophies and do things very differently. Some people say that `@property` can make it unclear whether getting/setting a property has any side effects or other unexpected behaviour. So experiment with it and see what works for you.,1
@sebkuip The major version (3) didn't change so no breaking changes (apart from what was deprectated/undefined behaviour).,0
@kendalk08 do you mean `None`?,0
There's no `null` in Python,0
@Samurai 1) It's `except Exception as e`2) in Python 3 `print` is a function so you need to do `print(e)`,0
https://i.imgur.com/HBLgfsa.png im trying to import external modules like discord.py in the exe im building with py2exe but im getting this any ideas why?,1

@lakmatiol :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```hello```,0
uh why do you ignore the input's return,0
the input currently doesnt do anything,0
since you never assign the val to a variable,0
"```pythonx = input(""Name:"").lower()if x == roman"": print(""something"")```",0

Anybody decent with scrapy?,0
hello,0
yes,0
well how to send someone an email,0
For someone brand new coding with absolutely no knowledge whatsoever but very interested in the idea and learning code or programing where would you recommend them start out to get a good start?,1
well i recommend mosh's python tutorial,0
!resources @Deleted User Also check our resources list with tons of videos and other things,0
,0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc,0
this one is better for absolute beginners,0
@Deleted User watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc,0
@Adios well u learn python by doing it not taking notes stup,0
well if u do that then u remember,0
unlike stupid nerds who takes notes for all the classes i hate notes and notes are a middle man,0
,0
well i not toxic i advising you to not take notes but try them out live,0
stupid people take notes cus that waste of time,0
@kendalk08 sublime,0
VS Code is also a fine choice for Python plus other things because it's openended,0
@lakmatiol seriously pycharm is a monster who eats resources of your computer,0
who??,0
no im not,0
pycharm is really heavy,0
:incoming_envelope: :ok_hand: applied warning to @ItsFab.,0
hello whirld,0
yeah I like that we have addons not just for Python but for specific Python packages,0
e.g. Cython there's syntax support for that in an addon,0
me laughing when sublime has support for most languages,0
@Adios depends on what you mean. If for instance you were delivering JS to a browser in a Flask app you could have the .js be a string,1
well vsc need a lot of setup than sublime to be honest,0
pycharm is really good at doing python things which is what I like,0
@Adios well .js runs on the frontend and backend but .py only runs on the backend,0
even install setup is so easy like installing game,0
download it first,0
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.6/python3.8.6amd64.exe this is the installer for the most recent version on Windows. @Shock_,0
@Symbol in Python lists and arrays are two different things. lists are onedimensional collections of Python objects. arrays are onedimensional collections of integers or floats only mainly for the sake of interoperating with C,1
yes there is,0
Wait Python doesn’t have arrays does it unless you bring in Numpy?,0
f sting,0
@JeeveStobs the `array` module provides them in the standard lib but they don't have the same functionality as the numpy equivalent,1
lists are already arrays in the data structure sense and it also has numerical arrays with the `array` package,0
```__stuff__```are called dunder methods,0
they're mainly for C interop,0
How do you guys format separate words in your message?,0
@Symbol I'm just referring to what set `list` and `array` apart specifically.,0
JavaScript HTML CSS,0
@JustOscarJ there's a number of reasons why that might never happen but it's a nice dream,0
the first problem is that we can't currently use anything but JS easily in the browser. And yes you can transpile the Python runtime to WASM but that's clunky and not really a solution,1
the second problem is that languages tend to be domainspecific and that's actually the lesser of the two issues but JS just has a massive head start in terms of how it deals with the front end generally,1
``` self.vel += self.acc self.pos += self.vel + 0.5  self.acc```,0
that's the idea. You use Python for the backend and HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend,0
can someone explain this formula?,0
self.acc is acceleration,0
@JustOscarJ is this some sort of math formula,0
its being used for player movement,0
ah,0
i hate motion formulas 😐,0
the comment on this code says it adds in realistic movement,0
the games i made i just added velocity to my x and y,0
yes @kendalk08,0
yeah,0
for booleans / nonetype use `if` instead of `==`,0

for booleans / nonetype use if instead of ==,0
if is a keyword,0

did you make a mc server in py?,0
Nope but I saw lot bots do that,0
Maybe they use discord.js?,0

What about fivem @Notepad ?,0
idk what fivem is,0
Yeah just a client that use lua,0
lua is trash u dont import shit,0

Any idea why my markdown for docstrings isn't displaying in VSCode?,0
start by copying existing code and then learn by modifying it incrementally until you're writing your own in time.,0
but you don't get anywhere without working with code in some form.,0
!resources @snake hecker video recommendations in here,0
,0
@JZ i dont think markdown docstrings is a thing,0
@Notepad I saw someone get it working on reddit and I essentially followed their design,0
ok,0
but you shouldnt use it,0

!codeblocks @Mudy,0
,0
mm ok I see. Thanks 😉,0
somoene teach me how to code,0
i know this has nothing to do with python but im wanting to move on to web developement would php backend+reactjs frontend be a good idea? if not what are better combos,1
depends on your objective,0
if you want to work then try to learn what's more abundant in the industry as web development,0
i recently participated in hacktoberfest and im prob gonna get 50 dollars in web hosting credit soon and i was thinking i want to try building websites i know a decent amount of python but i want to learn stuff that ill actually use in web developement if i actually end up really enjoying it,1
If it's your first time trying to develope websites I recommend you to host it first before paying any host,0
Learn from it and then do a project,0
yeah thats why i want to learn now,0
im saying thats the reason im trying to learn,0
You can do the course CS50 I think it's call,0
pls can somoene teach me how to code,0
bruh,0
btw thanks NLD ill look it up,0
np,0
@Davex You should grab a tutorial or a book and practice a lot,0
Well you want a organized file with all the data instep of a long code no?,0
thats just an example of one a more useful situation is when you are compiling lots and lots of lists of things and you want to select certain data off those lists its organization,1
Yep for machine learning for example it helps a lot,0
@Itz_MK Sometimes data is not defined directly in your code. Sometimes it's loaded from a file or received over a network connection for example.,1
^^,0
@Itz_MK You can represent dictionarylike data in some file formats. You can then load that format from the file into a Python dictionary in your code.,1
thats really true i struggled alot with the why when you should just keep going,0
Kinda agree with Light,0
that kinda stuff sits at the back of your mind and as you create stuff it pops up as an efficient method of completing something,1
thats what happened with me and i know a lot of othe rpeople,0
@Manjiro assert takes a boolean expression and if it's false it raises an exception.,0
It's a way to basically make your program break if certain conditions are not fulfilled.,0
Any code after the assert will not be executed unless the exception is handled.,0
Otherwise the program will just terminate.,0
@Manjiro https://realpython.com/pythonexceptions/,0
@Manjiro asserts are rarely used in practice.,0
It's a way to check that your code behaves correctly and to make it fail if it doesn't but there's usually better ways to handle errors in your code.,1
Hi,0
Outside of tests it's rare in any code.,0
I am new,0
@Obie jr Hi,0
pls someone teach me coding,0
pls,0
Im still not sure what languages i should learn for front and backend developement would reactjs and php be good?,0
,0
@dementati hi,0
@Davex This is an educational Python server so we can certainly teach you coding.,0
Can I be taught too,0
@dot Well being a Python server we will be inclined to recommend you learn Python for backend rather than PHP.,0
@Manjiro assert True will not do anything and assert False will always raise an exception.,0
what program you use to code?,0
@Obie jr Anyone can be taught.,0
So pls how does it work?,0
hahah @dementati i get that but i was looking around and compared to other languages python is just not as web developement oriented which i get python is supposed to less oriented towards one subject but i dont know anywhere else to ask,1
this is the only coding server im aware of,0
i meant official,0
@Manjiro you should open a help room if its taking this long,0
what were you having trouble with?,0
@Laid ?,0
@dot Python is very weboriented. I mean in the sense that it's one of the major use cases for Python and it is widely used for that purpose.,1
What about front end developement any suggestions there?,0
i just know php is more commonly used as well for backend so i kinda wanted to look into there,0
Is there any one who can spare sometime to introduce python to me,0
!resources @Obie jr Check out this page. There are a lot of resources for complete beginners.,0
,0
i hate that when you accidently click off a help channel it dissaperes and then you cant find it anymore,0
whats the error message,0
@dot React and Angular are both popular frontend frameworks.,0
yeah i was saying reactjs but is react and python a good combo? are there lots of help forums about using the two together?,1
or is there something more commonly used that might present an easier learning curve,0
what program you use to coding,0
or prove to be more useful in the long run more so,0
@Laid could you copy paste the code?,0
@dot It doesn't really matter which front and backend you choose. They generally communicate with a HTTPbased API so the choice of language doesn't influence it that much. At least not in most cases.,1
k one thing i would reccomend is creating a list of diceroll possiblities,0
@Laid because you can just select a random output from there,0
@dot Python and React can definitely work well.,0
thats good to know,0
thanks!,0
guess im off to learn django,0
@Laid for me it prints,0
Would you like to roll the dice?noGame Over{None},0
okay you mean after saying yes,0
I though u mean when u launch it,0
Wait @dementati what are your thoughts on CSS?,0
cus i know that looks really nice,0
Hey guys I made a program to do a coin flip 10k times and I tried to add a text that would print If heads had a greater amount and I trued but I don't know how,1

@dot CSS is used for styling web pages. It's an essential part of web development but aside from that I don't really have any particular thoughts about it.,1
Reinstalled a couple times to all users,0
I'd be happy to screenshare,0
yeah but isnt react used for design too?,0
@dot CSS is essential for web development,0
@Deleted User That's more or less what it's used for yes. It lets you define a new function which can be composed of multiple other statements.,1
> Hey I'm kind of new to python can you use def to construct a new command that is made up of a lot of code@Deleted User Could someone help me out?,1
Probably where would I go for that,0
you wrote it wrong,0
@Neem Mind if I send you the batch script and requirements.txt file?,0
@dot React is a JS framework. It's used for handling the functional part of your frontend. It's about function not aesthetics.,1
so i would need to learn CSS for design ReactJS for frontend and django for backend no?,0
ohhhh,0
Is there anyone that can help answer me?,0
You use HTML to structure a frontend CSS to style it and JS to program it.,0
Damn rip. So how would I clear those folders?,0
I'm down to do a full reinstall,0
so where does python fit in?,0
sorry i just started learning about web developemnt,0
@dot I recommend u w3school to learn html and css,0
@dot Python is for the backend.,0
:trash:,0
i thought js was for backend,0
@dot A frontend runs in the enduser's web browser. A backend runs on your server.,0
i get that,0
No JS is usually for running code in the browser.,0
oh ok its confusing since you can use it for backend too,0
You can use JS as a backend language through Node.js,0
i thought you were saying use js as backend,0
Do I put a define at the top of my script?,0
@dot It was originally only for the frontend. Then someone thought it would be convenient if you could use the same language for both frontend and backend and that's why node.js was invented.,1
aight,0
b ruh,0
Do I put a define at the top of my script? I'm kind of confused,0
well so is the only purpose of reactjs to simply organize bigger web stuff?,0
> `so if assert False that means the code underneath it wont be runned for sure?`@Manjiro I believe so,0
or is it linking front to backend,0
bruh,0
So how would I use a defined script?,0
!paste @fucdapols Please use this for larger pastes.,0
,0
I guess,0
How would I do that in a if answer = text :,0
would you recommend installing packages globally by using administrator? @Neem,0
Ok thanks!,0
through input @Deleted User ?,0
@dot JS in general is used to control the user's web browser. It can for example be used to retrieve data from the backend and update part of a website without having to reload the whole thing. React orchestrates these partial updates in a very sophisticated way.,1
how is the person submitting an answer,0
Answer = input,0
@dot It results in very fast and responsive web apps.,0
oh ok cool,0
But thank you guys really,0
so basically django reactjs html and css would all be good ideas for a webserver,0
combined,0
@dot Yeah sure. There are CSS frameworks too like bootstrap.,0
It helps you make your site look good without having to style it manually yourself.,0

`python3` isn't really a windows keyword. `py` is for windows 10 though. And then you just needed to make sure you were either in the same folder as the python file or specify the correct file path to that python file.,1

ye YT vids are bad,0
has anyone done or tried courseras python courses ? i was thinking of doing a class for that to learn the basics,1
i dont know how to code,0
i tried sololearn but i didn’t learn well from it cause i wasn’t actually doing the code i was just filling in blanks,1
,0
fair enough,0
i realized it was more based around the syntax but you can’t even run the code without buying a subscription on their app lol i wasn’t a big fan,1

i’m not sure how hard discord.py is early on,0
"but i dont know how to code something i dotn no maybe something like print (""....."")",0
studio if you wanna learn the only way you can is by finding a source to learn from. i am 99% sure you won’t find someone here willing to guide you through it but the discord is here tk give resources to learn,1
search google for a specific thing you want to do and go from there,0

Currently learning python as my first programming language i mean I've learnt node.js plus discord.js before. But not in depth.,0
So i was just wondering if the difference in speed was substantial.,0
Gotcha.,0
Well I'm gonna continue to work to learn it currently at learning dependencies.But yeah oh I'm gonna learn C as well hope it isn't hard tbh.,1
the general dynamic nature of the language certainly is a problem when accessing anything involves hashing strings that comes with a cost,1
But isn't C and C++ for another type of purpose?,0
for large projects the performance does matter,0
but that's definitely not the only criteria,0
Or is it the same data science stuff.,0
yeah i’m learning c but the only thing i really know is how to print something lmao,0
Gotcha.,0
Well I've been learning python pretty greatly so far.,0
I tried doing `from PIL install Image` but it says there is no such thing as PIL any quick way to fix that?,1
The only thing i haven't completely understood yet was the return in a function.,0
@thevoidzero i will at schopl anyway. So I'm doing home studies on py and I'm gonna learn C here.,0
Windows 10,0
I did `import Pillow` but it still says `No module named Pillow`,0
I tried to do some code with user input and functions and if statements but it didn't go as well.,0
I have genuinely no idea how to do `pip install`,0
@thevoidzero So C first py second?,0
I did it before but never knew how,0
pip install ....,0
maybe dont learn C as your first language,0
@Pedro. At my school that's what i would've learnt anyway.,0
But i am learning py at home don't exile me pls.,0
,0
ah its different with a teacher though,0
`Der Befehl pip ist entweder falsch geschrieben oder konnte nicht gefunden werden.`(`The command pip is either written incorrectly or could not be found`),1

@thevoidzero so 1 line in python to print how many in C?,0
I genuinely have no idea how I installed Python 😅,0
Jesus.,0
i mean the actual print function is just 1 but you gotta do some setup,0
So python is 5 hours for the full course and I'm documenting all I'm being teached how much would it be in C? Over 9000?,1
the free code camp one doesnt reach 4 hours but its for beginners,0
I got a few Warnings,0
@Akarys it goes over the basic stuff but I'm documenting everything I'm being teached.,0
```WARNING: The script easy_install3.8.exe is installed in C:\\Users\\[mynane]\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python38\\Scripts which is not on PATH.

So I just tried installing Pillow,0
noooooooooooooo dont give me resources,0
`Running setup.py install for Pillow ... error`,0
And a ton of red lines,0
why do you want a while loop in tkinter?,0
@OpalMist no I have not,0
yes @thevoidzero,0
I'm not at my computer at the moment but if you want I can show you tomorrow @OpalMist,0
The purpose of the loop is to check if two times are greater than or equal to each other and I keep getting an error,1

this exercise,0
Since v is a list,0
guys 1 doubt,0
how do i make it so that p is appended?,0
what is the purpose of df.shape(),0
> what is the purpose of df.shape()@! Vik ??,0
you want to find the pnorm of v?,0
no i want to return it or the euclidean norm,0
and df.head(),0
@! Vik df head is to see the first 10 index of your data set so you get the idea of what it looks like,1
yeah so you can implement norm(v p),0
and df.shape?,0
my bad,0
norm(v) == norm(v 2),0
how do I give p a default value empty @Deleted User,0
oh wait i can just set p=0,0
yeah...,0
but that has to apply to all other inputs,0
since it can be norm(v p q r s ...),0
now I am confused what are you really doing?,0
a norm can only be applied to one vector at a time,0
it doesn't make sense to allow `norm(v p q r s)`,0
also what are q r s? acc to you,0
v is by default a vector [4 3] for example;every other argument p q r s ... is appended so that it becomes a larger ndimensiona vectornorm([4 3] 3 5 1 2)vector = [4 3 3 5 1 2] @Deleted User @lgneous,1
where all can we use dataframes in real life?,0
make `volume` a property that computes that @Urkchar,0
```py@propertydef volume(self): return self.length  ...```,0
I think you are confusing what norm(v p) actually does,0
that way it's 1) readonly 2) gets computed every time even if the values were updated,0
its not appending p to v,0
OH,0
you are right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is my issue,0
`norm(v p)` computes the `pnorm` of `v`,0
damn i'm dumb,0
its pth root(v[0]^p + v[1]^p + ... ),0
> where all can we use dataframes in real life?@! Vik ?,0
see the formula in the image you posted here,0
yeah yeah i see now,0
how do you make nth root in python without numpy?,0

guys?,0

> @! Vik when you have a lot of data you need to handle generally. You'll _know_ when you need something generally.@Luckayla i didnt understand bro,1
well if there is only 1 list it should be decent,0
@! Vik why are you trying to understand these ?,0
i mean what i am trying to say is i am learning for the exam so i need to understand it ryt,1
@Phaedra Leonidas there are some good free books,0
@Phaedra Leonidas http://datasciencemasters.org/,0
@! Vik Man you have an exam on data science and you're not trying to understand on your own? I envy you,1
ok,0
so finally what are the uses of dataframes in real life?,0
@Phaedra Leonidas Data science is a huge area though depends on what kind of thing you want to do,0
@! Vik bro you clearly have no interest in these studies just go to google,0
@Phaedra Leonidas Ehh you just need a good foundationFor example; Know other languages? Like c++?Do you know Statistics & probability well?Do you know Linear Algebra?Do you know Convex optimization? Are you interested in data analysis data visualization machine learning or natural language processing?,1
Just read a lot about it and check out if it's something you want to do,0
@Phaedra Leonidas Then check out the link I sent:http://datasciencemasters.org/scroll down to ML,0
@Urkchar I don't think volume should be settable at all as it entirely depends on the other attributes you should either make a volume method or a read only attribute,1
"Also your code is invalid because it should be volume.setter,not property.setter",0
Most resources out there are practical so check out the theoretical and read a lot about them.Even though practical can be fun you will realize you know way too little about how it works and you will also realize you will need a lot of computing power to actually do interesting things. Like it won't get you a job; but if you have good foundations and grasp on the theoretical you are a much better candidate,1
Cause honestly employers look for people who have good problem solving capabilities and good understanding of difficult and theoretical subjectsOtherwise you can just watch a youtube tutorial on how to make a face recognition app with python and tensorflow in 2 hours and you are done that's just nothing,1
but making a good prediction model on sales trends and evolving that requires lot of data mining cleaning and model traning and testing that shit needs a lot of knowledge,1
just have```pyclass T: # __init__ and all that jazz def volume(self): return self.x  self.y```,0
alternatively making it a property,0
you did,0
but don't return `self._volume` in it,0
you don't need any volume attribute,0
`if not isinstance(x int): raise TypeError`,0
(you should raise a typeerror here not a valueerror),0
you can also pass a message with the type error which you probably should,0
"`raise TypeError(""argument must be an int"")` or whatever",0
yes,0
that's the correct way to do it,0
it makes no sense to be able to do `self.volume = 4`,0
because there's no need to,0
"it shouldn't be allowed for the volume to be 4 if the length width height are like 100,100,100",0
lenovo batteries were always pretty bad,0
it's not a getter in the traditional sense as it doesn't get an attribute per se but it has the same interface as an attribute,1
which is the most important part,0

No these languages are too complicated for a first language I’d say @HELL WARRIORS,0
You should start with an easy language first,0
I don't think tfrecords are much bigger than npy @Nemesis but the issue is that you should probably process the data in batches when building your tfrecords,1
you should use shards anyway,0
in fact i'm confident the problem comes from the fact that you are using npy which doesn't allow for batch reading,1
ah i see,0
let me pull a simple example of how you should do it but basically you don't want to store the large arrays in memory,1
retrieve them in batches of 1/2/4/8/16/whatever and write them then delete/replace them,0
because you generated the npy files one by one,0
which line causes the memory error exactly ? @Nemesis,0
because your code looks okish but the 2 sorted at the top are suspicious,0
oh,0
just means you don't have enough storage yea,0
you can delete the npy file after you `writer.write` the array,0
then that means there isn't enough storage to store the TFRecords,0
not much you can do other than not using TFRecords,0
if your end goal is to use `tf.data.Dataset` you can directly build one from a generator,0
kaggle has TPUs ?,0
also no you don't need tfrecords to use TPUs,0

"> compress any file to minimum possible no more possible to a single bitthe algorithm:`f.write(b""\\x00"")`",0
you don't actually write the 0s and 1s you write values that represent your 0s and 1s in binary,0
otherwise you're doing the opposite of compression,0
I don't believe you but I hope you're having fun,0
just read in `b` mode,0
then generate your `bytes` `f.write(my_bytes)`,0
you're confused on what binary is,0
you don't actually read 0s and 1s,0
you read for example `'0'` which is `48` which is `0b110000`,0
some algorithms force you to deal with individual bits,0
like since we're on the topic of compression huffman trees for example,0
```pywith open(FILE_PATH rb') as f: content_bytes = f.read()```,0
there you go,0
actually if you specify `b` do you have to also specify `r`,0
or is it still on by default,0
nope needs rb,0
you don't understand what binary/hex/decimal mean,0
they're just ways to represent information in this case numbers,0

oof,0
big rip,0
@TechSupportBall I did yes but there are plenty of scenarios for pattern matching apart from that one use case,0
also I've written a compiler in Python admittedly not a very good one because my compiler chops are not advanced but it is possible,1
@sahil04 they can be downloaded from the Python.org site and you can check out nightly source trees from their Github mirror,1
@Skynse well the compiler i wrote did generate machine native executables,0
@kendalk08 yes hang in there and let the use case emerge naturally.,0
@Skynse I used the LLVM backend to generate the assembly for which there is a Python library,0
and in all honesty LLVM was the slowest link in the chain,0
@sahil04 with the previous generation of software,0
yup,0
Do I choose VCS or Pycharm?,0
that\'s called bootstrapping,0
what is bootstrapping,0
if you get a language to the point where you can write a compiler in it then you can typically write the compiler in its own language,1
woah writing a compiler,0

@Tapuzi I liked it fine I just wasn't good at it. I was using Lark as my parser generator,0
nice,0
@Tapuzi Lark is native Python faster than ANTLR,0
what does antlr do? looking it up it parses code but what do you do with the output,0
@sahil04 lmfao,0
I started with Lark to parse the code into an AST then processed that to generate LLVM instructions,0
then the LLVM IR gets compiled and voila native assembly,0
interesting,0

even a bad game that exists can be made into a better one so that's great that you made it,0
@Tapuzi YW!,0
the best way to do this is to keep each individual letter as an element in a list change them in the list and then just render the list to a string whenever you want it shown as a string.,1
does anyone have recommendatiosn for a place to practise numpy?,0
that way you don't have to keep bursting the string apart and changing it etc. you can just keep one master list of the letters in the string.,1

@Ping for toast look in the system tray (where the clock etc. is) and expand it with the arrow if need be. There might be an icon there that normally says ENG or some other language identifier and see if you can click on it. I think you might have selected another input method.,1
"> What is __setattr__?@DABABYCAR ```pythona.b = 1setattr(a,'b',1)both are same```",0

@ShalokShalom that's not on topic for this channel sorry,0
> can anyone help me add Pyinstaller to path quickly? if u can please ping or dm me!,0
Ooh,0
,0
@DABABYCAR ```pythona.b = 1```this calls the \\__setattr__ method of a,0
@kendalk08 the basic idea behind classes is that they give you an elegant way to manage state,0
(I don't know if that word came up in your courses),0
@Infinimata there wasent anything in my tray but I typed langudge into it and I think after I reclicked english my spaces are normal?thanks.no clue how i did it,1
@Ping for toast you probably had some other input method selected. This has happened to me before!,0
@AZ thats easy,0
@Ping for toast I think WinkeySpace toggles between the input methods so be careful about that,0
ah thanks!,0
please can someone help me,0
I just need to add pyinstaller to path,0
@AZ yeah sure so,0
@kendalk08 state is the term for the condition of all the variables in your program basically. If you have state managed by way of lots of variables it can get unwieldy. Classes let you pack up state into single objects that are easier to work with and think about,1
@FlamingArrow I think there's a way to do what you ask might want to ask in #internalsandpeps,0
what does this mean,0
@kendalk08 correct. You can think of a user as a single thing with all the different components of it accessible from it easily.,1
@kendalk08 game devs for instance use classes to represent the state of the entire game in a single unit so it can be saved/loaded easily (among other things),1
@DABABYCAR no but `a = b = 1` will,0
@dewi it does,0
I'm on phone,0
I'm on my phone I'm not gonna read a pastebin sorry,0
@kendalk08 right. a class saves you the trouble of having to do all that. It gives you organization,0

@Ping for toast are you running that from within PyCharm's console?,0
@Infinimata yes,0
@Ping for toast aha. I think `os.get_terminal_size()` will only report back a valid value if you run it in the actual cmdline.,1

@Ping for toast haha yes. Basically that command calls an API that tries to obtain the console size from the OS. I don't think PyCharm's console heeds those APIs hence the crashodecrash,1

globals are modulewide while static variables are still bound to the class,0
yeah,0
you can access it with `ClassName.attribute`,0
@sentientMeat Maybe this could be of interest https://pypi.org/project/pytexit/,0
static class attributes are actually as bad as globals but people like hiding things pretending they're not global like with singletons so that they don't feel bad,1
it's a global with a namespace,0

keyword only arguments can only be given with the keyword,0
positional only arguments are positional only,0
normal args can be both,0
```pyfoo(x) # positionalfoo(a=x) # keyword``` @Higgs,0
positional means that the arguments are passed based on their position in the paramlist,0
it means the parameters after are keyword only,0
if you don't put that `` you could do `wait_for(some_event some_check some_timeout)`,0
ah yeah,0
it's similar to `args`,0
in the sense that `args` captures all the positional arguments this does the same but crashes if a parameter is passed,1

@Reidivy by default a function returns `None` so unless your function needs to return something specific you don't have to,0
@Reidivy no you can return if your method require return. or you can do a void function with just do stuff and not return,1

@neoncraxks turn it into a string and slice out the last character,0
do they write python interpreter in python or c ... cuz if it's c/c++ then i cant help much sadddddd,0
@neoncraxks u could use string formatting but i dont remember how to do that with floats,0
use formatting ig its `print('{.2f} % gram)`,0
yes that,0
How do I make it so + signs arent converted to %2B,0
@Wasabi upcoming features are publically discussed you can see the different PEPs as well as the what\'s new ? sections on releases,1
@JagTheFriend use `print('Your cost is ${:.2f}'.format(a))`,0
there must be an f string equivalent but i forgot,0
How do I make it so + signs arent converted to %2B,0
?,0
use `url_encode` in some builtin package,0
Lol,0
Im trying to have a string and add + to the string but i get %2b,0
hes been answered already! @JagTheFriend,0
which doesnt work for me,0
From future import braces is the first nerdy programming joke ive laughed at,0
@dicem0ney try that in the python interpreter ;),0
@Deleted User please give more context cuz I'm assuming you want to concat url?,0
I fixed it for some reason instead of doing string + + i do string +   and it adds a plus. strange,1
!e help(range),0
You are not allowed to use that command here. Please use the #botcommands channel instead.,0
range() is a separate class,0
lol @Dexa run that thing I send in #botcommands,0
@Wasabi i dont think the help() for range is that helpful,0
iirc range give you a generator and you need to turn that to value using list,0
range returns a range object,0
like help() shows all methods attributes everything. not just a simple explanation.,0

yes,0
guys is there a javadoc equivalent in python? people creating beautiful readthedocs page but is that like... generated or you coded it,1
how would i do that? or is there like a stack over flow?,0
use the replace method for strings,0
@Wasabi there are plenty!,0
yes,0
im not familer with the replace method ill look it ip thanks,0
@dicem0ney have u tried `from __future__ import braces` yet?,0
Have not lol,0
do ittt,0
I'll have to! :D,0
yes Sphinx is for project docgen,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan sorry for the ping but what if i user inputs hello and i want to replace H with 5 then e with B etc,1
any idea how i could do that,0
you have a dict of key is what you want to replace and value is what you want to replace,0
then you go through each char and do it,0
"@Deleted User ```input().replace(""e b"")```",0
replaces e with b,0
> @JagTheFriend use `print('Your cost is ${:.2f}'.format(a))`@Wasabi Why not `print(f'Your cost is {a}')` ? Its way shorter... and less painful to look at,1
ok ill give it a go thanks,0
> @Wasabi Why not `print(f'Your cost is {a}')` ? Its way shorter... and less painful to look at@Deleted User the requirement is he want 2 decimal place,1

@Kyan Unclosed `(`,0
input already returns a string,0
@Kyan Also it's not clear what you're trying to do `input` already returns a string so `str` doesn't do anything here and it certainly won't throw an error.,1
yeah i originally had it as just author but it didnt work,0
which is why i made an f string in hopes it would work,0
is there any advantage to doing this: ```pydef foo(bar: str) > None: print(bar)```over this:```py def foo(bar): print(bar)```,0
@Kyan `input` always returns a string. A string is just a bunch of characters  letters numbers anything.,0

ahh my head,0
"@kendalk08 you could try a dictionary and a list like```pystudents = {""name : [""age gender""]}```",0
hello,0
I want any time a function runs it to add to a int by 1,0

can someone help me? I want count to be added by 1 any time the function runs,0
you just add ```pycount += 1```,0
yeah after you declaired count dont make it global that makes it become a massive mess,0
,0
also id get rid of the count == 0 that wont do anything,0
,0
its 2 at midnight my brain feels like a microwave.,0
@kendalk08 you can do that like having a user file per student?,0
so I should add ?,0
@Deleted User you need to get rid of the count == 0,0
so its already a int,0
"```pythonimport randomimport timeimport stringlimit = input(""Enter the codes limit that you want to print: )count = 0def printing(): global count string.ascii_letters \'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890\' one = random.choice(string.ascii_letters) two = random.choice(string.ascii_letters) three = random.choice(string.ascii_letters) four = random.choice(string.ascii_letters) five = random.choice(string.ascii_letters) six = random.choice(string.ascii_letters) seven = random.choice(string.ascii_letters) eight = random.choice(string.ascii_letters) nine = random.choice(string.ascii_letters) ten = random.choice(string.ascii_letters) eleven = random.choice(string.ascii_letters) twelve = random.choice(string.ascii_letters) thirteen = random.choice(string.ascii_letters) fourteen = random.choice(string.ascii_letters) fifteen = random.choice(string.ascii_letters) sixteen = random.choice(string.ascii_letters) text_one = https://discordapp.com/gifts/"" count += 1 print(text_one one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen sep=\'\') passfor count in limit: printing() print(count)```",1
@Deleted User the global could be messing it up,0
and that too,0
my brain gone random,0
so what I should change?,0
oof in that for loop rename count to something else,0
cause its making count a string,0
so I should use format?,0
@kendalk08 i forget do you have a mic? sorry tryna type an give help is a little hard,0
ight hop in the Code/help channel if you can,0
@MayActual,0
would you be able to change my code for me so it would work?,0
is it graded at all?,0
i keep getting a syntax error on this but i can't understand why,0
@kendalk08 if you wouldn't mind hoping into the vc that im in i can help you a lot easier,0
> @MayActual wheres that at?@kendalk08 you're deafened,0
wait where?,0
yes where?,0
on the line before?,0
does any body knows how exactly modulus operates when using float numbers to operate? like 20 % 1.3?,0
i have to go foward or backwards?,0
probably not here,0
sorry if if my english is not great,0

@Deleted User you can get rid of the pass count,0
you don't need it,0

How can I work with databases in Python?I've done it on Java before but I have no idea for PythonI have MySQL btw,1
I want count to be the count of how much the function ran,0

@yardshop would you be able to do it if I'll send the code?,0

oh,0
.,0
so I should send it there?,0
@Deleted User change ``` for count in range(limit): ``` to something like ``` for count in range(len(limit)): ```,0
can you # one?,0
,0
not omg I typed one,0
either works,0
it sends the same error,0
@kronos JanboGem,0
oh i thought it was a string 😂,0
can you mention any python help channel that is available?,0
```pyfor count in range(limit): if count<limit: count += 1 printing() print(count) else: break```I think this should work @Deleted User,0

no i thought that we were getting the length of the string 😂 sorry im tired,0

I gotta learn Java for a class... This hurts so much,0

Thu Oct 08 18:24:35 CDT 2020There was an unexpected error (type=Not Found status=404).No message available,0
Java is a mess,0
Yeah I know the basic Java language but I gotta learn some real uses of it. I thought Spring would be a good place to start,1
```pyfor iteration in range(limit): if count<limit: count += 1 printing() print(count) else: break```@Deleted User Did this work?,0
I could copy and paste someone else's code in Java and it could legit just not run on my system for whatever reason,1
The language is a mess,0
well you can't just do that in java,0
I miss NodeJS it was so much nicer to me,0
Python and Javascript are nice to me anything outside of that is terrifying beyond belief,0
Except maybe Rust,0
what is the difference between java and js??,0
That question makes me violently angry,0
why...,0
I think JS is for web developing,0
Javascript is a mostly frontend language with some backend capabilities too. Java is purely backend and absolutely evil,0
backend is how it functions and frontend is how it looks?Am I correct?,0
Nah gotta be even more douchey about it call it ES6,0
backend and frontend both deal with the functionality but backend is what happens on the server side while front end happens on the client side,1
Java is what made Minecraft Javascript is what made Discord huge difference,0

Why does every Python youtube tutorial involve an Indian man recording the audio through his microwave,0
i am certain that is inaccurate,0
I mean I've gone through a lot of tutorials over the last year,0
sometimes they're not indian and sometimes it's a calculator not a microwave,0
well there are good tutorials,0
can you help me,0
@Deleted User i guess you need to choose better?,0
There's a wonderful series on asyncio by Lukasz Langa so far it's the best python tutorial I've seen,0
Hard when it's a niche module,0
@Deleted User which module?,0
scrapy,0
Tbh the Indian guy I'm watching now is pretty good,0
It took 4 videos to get here though,0
@Deleted User maybe youtube is the wrong medium,0
@Skynse I have but I tend to like watching a tutorial to kick things off,0
From what I've seen youtube tutorials are fine if you want an overview of something general. There's no point in recording a video tutorial on all aspects of a specific library  it's very timeconsuming and it's very hard to find something specific inside a video,1
> From what I've seen youtube tutorials are fine if you want an overview of something general. There's no point in recording a video tutorial on all aspects of a specific library  it's very timeconsuming and it's very hard to find something specific inside a video@fix error Yeah basically,1

Once it becomes more specialised I tend to use documentation and stackoverflow a lot more,0
Videos help a lot for intro structure though,0
No lol I went through the scrapy tutorial and it worked then I wanted a harder challenge and found one on youtube,1
Still trying to work through the latter,0
Turns out my terrible understanding of xpaths has a lot to do with it so I'm cleaning that up with youtube vids for now,1
Yes,0
> It took me a while to understand how to read documentation but it was super worth it afterwards@Skynse Yeah it took me a while too,1
I think once you've got a the general hang of a new module the documentation becomes vital,0
But intro with documentation I tend to find too hard unless it's a very simply module,0
Usually documentation tends to skimp on the examples too much for my liking,0
In my view videos are for teaching something meaningful  they are not information dumps. Some things are just not worthwhile to learn like some specific API in a library.,1
I think I did one of these video courses when I first started out,0
> Some things are just not worthwhile to learn like some specific API in a library.I remember how my university wanted to test what we\'ve learned so far and gave us an unexpected test.

is there a way to view the html path on inspect?,0
God I hate front end stuff,0
I only need to learn enough to scrape,0
It isn\'t hard so to speak just horribly messy,0
Is there no way of just viewing the html path like class>tr>td>a>href,0
Rather than having scroll through the entire html sheet,0
@Deleted User doesn't your browser's devtools offer a thing to do that?,0
I mean I'm looking but I can't find an obvious one,0
I'm using Chrome,0
I mean within inspect,0
Can I view the tree for a specific element,0
Rather than the entire page,0
@Skynse Yeah but it shows me the element within the entire page,0
Can't I just view it like class>tr>td>a>href,0
And cut out all the other html on the page,0
@Deleted User right click the element  Copy  Copy XPath,0
Oh okay,0
"//[@id=""main""]/div/span/div/div/div[3]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[2]/a",0

what are the bracket numbers like div[3] referring too?,0
Ah okay,0

@SansPapyrus683 why do you want the cwd? You can write the code to not care,0
@notaduck448 yeah but I want the code to be like the output,0
Thanks @Jac_k is there anyway to do the same but without counting the \?,0
Do you want to display like that in your code? Or in the output?,0
If that latter write it likeinput('this \ is \ a \ test'),0
I want a multiline in the code so I can explain each option,0
as comments,0
Yeah but without jumping the line with \,0
For example in a regex explain every character of it,0
Or every group.,0
Join seems good,0

@apopathodiaphulatophobia,0
they both have their own use cases,0
if you are a beginner i'd reccomend python first get the entire coding idea into your headd then move to java,1
as someone who is just now learning java if I didn't do python first this would be far more complicated,0
syntax is very in python nice I doubt I will find a language with any better,0
Depends on what u wanna do. If u want to create websites then go with html and JavaScript. If u dont know what u wanna do I recommend python,1
Or html,0
Very basic languages,0
html is barely a language imo lol,0
It still counts as one @Deleted User,0
it definitely counts. I just wouldn't tell someone to learn html first if they wanted to learn programming,0
Ok. Noted,0
I learned HTML and CSS in like an hour then learned javascript. I really wouldn't reccomend starting like this you can make some nifty web browser games but python is just really intuitive,1

rather it turns the folder into a package and you can import from it or the modules that it contains,0
"oh ok so it `""converts""` the folder into a package",0
for example:```py my_package  __init__.py  my_first_module.py  my_second_module.py main.py```,0

what's the best way to bypass rate limit with requests for free. Proxies are so slow and don't work half of the time.,1

maybe,0
you can do `import my_package` or `from my_package import my_first_module` or `from my_package import my_second_module` or even `from my_package import my_first_module my_second_module`,1
wdym sockets? @Spyros,0
or `from my_package.my_first_module import this_thing that_thing` etc.,0
the point is the toplevel `__init__.py` turns the folder into a package and the other files are modules,0

@squeakier rate limits are done serverside on most things so you'd need to configure proxies,0
@Saccharine proxies are so unreliable and so slow any other ways,0
the free proxy servers are,0
yeah,0
How do people make servers?,0
> what's the best way to bypass rate limits with requests for free?@squeakier ...is what you're doing against TOS?,0
but you can set up your own little cloud servers,0
no? all websites limit it,0
well most at least big ones,0
and install proxy software onto it or just use the ssh socks proxy,0
oh bypassing,0
i thought you meant using requests,0
!rule 5,0
,0
eh there are legitimate uses for bypassing rate limits; I remember doing a project where we were concerned about performance,0
and we wanted to stress test the thing on something as close to possible as production,0
there are indeed,0
but we never had to fake the IP addresses or anything,0

No No,0
i looks like one,0
wdym?,0
cosmic we are not allowed to do school homework,0
^^^^,0
we can give u hints... but we can't solve it for u,0
Okay please give me hints,0
so if you paste your code here we can tell you the mistakes and errors,0
I know the inputing data thing but o ith the loop function,0
?? o ith?,0
^^,0
Yes Hold Up Ill send it to you,0
len() setermines the length of the input,0
u may use for as well,0
input() asks for input,0
and do u have to use randint? did they teach u that?,0
list.append() does.......idk i never used it,0
adds a number to a list,0
> and do u have to use randint? did they teach u that?yeah it is very useful,0
so it just adds an item?,0
what rofl said is more accurate,0
kk thnx,0
ive been taught only lisr.append,0
list.append,0
ohhhhhh,0
now i get it,0
okay send the code cosmic,0
so it can add multiple items too?,0
and if u didn't do anything just say it don't worry,0
yes,0

yes pls,0
dont ask to ask. just ask,0

Trying to use this,0

first u need to use int(input())to add values,0
but that's a wrong approach,0
cuz the program tkaes input as strings,0
the problem says that u need to use loops,0
Yes?,0
"while for,if....",0
Do I need to input them as integers?,0
no,0

@M0rty look up discord.py documentation,0
@Jac_k it looks cool mind sharing the game?,0

not necessarily better. it is more concise and legible in most cases but there are things that `.format` can do that fstrings can't.,1

"@peanut123book `f.readlines()` returns a list of lines so `i` will take the value of each line in the file. Then you \'re printing that line: `print(line #"")`.

what is a variable,0
is it just a label?,0
im confused,0
no liek,0
say `x = 1`,0
we have created a reference to int object 1,0
but what is `x`,0
Hey why is that a default argument value of a list maintains the same list between function calls? Is there a reason for it? Seems like a strange choice.,1
no like the pointer is a pointer,0
but i wanna know,0
like what is `x` in our source code,0
so a pointer is stored either on heap or stack ye?,0
but where is `x` being stored,0
and what type is `x`?,0
because `x` doesnt really exist in byte code or does it?,0
i see thank,0
lol i was just curious,0
theres like a gap between code written by me and the code thats executing i feel like if i dont know more about this,1
~~abstraction intensifies~~,0
~~the thing is i m too noob to understand those docs on implementations lol~~,0
ah yes,0

@aryaniyaps Can you eat food from your fridge without opening it?,0
@aryaniyaps 1. You can read the `ContentLength` header without reading the whole thing2. I would assume that most image formats store the metadata like width and height in the beginning so theoretically you could read the metadata without reading the whole thing,1
They laughed at Columbus they laughed at Fulton they laughed at the Wright brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown.,1
Well you could do```/image.png?width=1280&height=720```but that doesn't make any sense whatsoever since `url` is the input to the server and the image size is the output from the server.,1
,0
@aryaniyaps As I said metainformation can be send in a header. Or well yes just have a separate endpoint like `/image_metadata/4234234`,1

@Spectrum If you just pass it it doesn't get copied.,0
ohh ok ok,0
i get it,0
you should use enumerate,0
why does each call need a copy?,0
@Spectrum You can add lists: `[1 2 3 4 5] + [6]`.,0
@Ice_trooper `1` is always truthy so it will always be `c == 0`,0
It's `(then_expr) if (condition) else (else_expr)`,0
adding lists is O(len(second_list)) right?,0
@Spectrum Adding two lists of sizes `n` and `m` is `O(n m)` yes.,0
oh,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan If you're using just `+` you're creating a copy not mutation the original one.,0
yeah,0
@Spectrum There are linked lists (maybe `deque` will work for you?),0
how would you have a mutable immutable list,0
apparently u can only delete an item from a list using it's slice,0
@Spectrum Can you tell what problem are you solving? Recursion is usually discouraged in Python (because of the stack depth limit and other performance limitations).,1
> whats the simplest version of ```py> a = 1> while a < 2020:> a += 1> while a > 1200:> print (a)> if a > 2020:> break ``` if that even works lol@aussie why dou have 2 while loops?,1
isn't 1 enough?,0
@Spectrum _mutation_ will not create a copy  that's why it's a mutation. And Haskell uses immutable linked lists so it's a different story (unless you're actually _mutating_ something in Haskell  it's not something ordinary),1
that's not a list though..,0
uh no,0
and you're pretty much already at that solution just with a while loop,0
@Spectrum I don't think there's a builtin immutable linked list in Python you'll have to make your own.,0
well...,0
...or maybe you can just use generators,0
why not print `num`,0

> They want to generate the same random numbers every time they run their programthen what's the point of random?,0
i don't get what you're asking. you wanna send the code to a different folder?,0
you need to `import` the code @DeletedAcc,0
just put in the path to where you wanna send it to,0
yeah but the randomly generated number would still be randomly generated each time even if the logic behind genertion is same innit ?,1
just put in the path to where you wanna send it to,0

yalls discord lagging?,0
?,0
@pratt you have 2 physical cores but 4 threads.,0
a unit of processing work.,0
most physical cores have 24 threads these days,0
so you can basically run 4 processes side by side if you have 4 hardware threads.,0
the reason you have hundreds of processes running at any given time is that the vast majroity of the time they're idle and the system switches between them as needed.,1
right,0
@drewsdrew hm good one not sure offhand  but is it doing the job for you?,0
so a 4 core cpu can hnadle 16 apps??,0
yes,0
@Hardsheep that is true,0
@ItsFab a 4 core CPU could handle 2000 apps as long as they were not all trying to max out the CPU at the same time,1
oh,0
^^same,0
apps typically spend most of their time just waiting on input.,0
but VS takes a lot of cpu,0
when we do `@propertie` we can call the method that is being decorated as an attribute but can we also call it as a method?,1
so modern hardware takes advantage of this and switches between them as needed.,0
like 50% on startup,0
@Deleted User that's not as abnormal as it sounds,0
oh,0
@Deleted User CPU usage can be deceptive. When you first launch a program there's a massive spike in CPU usage for it because the system is sampling an average of CPU usage for it over time.,1
so there's a spike which gradually declines.,0
ohhhhhh,0

@Infinimata can you help me to get and setup a virtual machine?,0
@Deleted User a virtual machine or a virtual environment?,0
machine,0
i mean in which i can run different OSs,0
which OS are you currently using?,0
in which wind comes in,0
lol,0
heh okay,0
@pratt as we were discussing above logical processors is hardware threads. 2 physical cores = 2 threads per core = 4 logical processors,1
?,0
and 1000+ threads is not unusual; most of those are sitting idle waiting for something to happen.,0
correct,0
4 threads that can be run at any one time. Most of the 1000+ are idle,0
L1/L2/L3 cache are allocations of memory directly on the CPU for reducing the amount of roundtrips needed to fetch data from main memory.,1
that thing will run Python just fine,0
ummmm you guys left my question,0
it's not related to python,0
@pratt the 4 threads are what the CPU can run at the same time at any given time. The 1000+ are what threads are running but not currently doing anything,1
neither is light's,0
@Deleted User are you familiar with VirtualBox?,0
nope,0
@Deleted User that's generally the best place to start with doing VMs on Windows because it's free.,0
https://www.virtualbox.org/ it's got pretty good documentation,0
can you DM for more info?,0
@pratt right more or less. Threads are switched between very quickly as needed,0
@Ice_trooper `int/float(input())`,0
that's not what he was asking,0

@SFM61319 the Pylance plugin for VS Code provides linting services,0
yeah I have been using ity and am very happy with it,0
add Pylance as an extension and restart and that should do it,0
hey guys I'd like to generate objects of a class I created that would end up in a list ( or array ?) every object has 2 generated variables. How do I generate them ? thanks!,1
@frownyfrog hmm yeah but Im not sure which commands should I use like to create a single object in the loop without explicitely give them a name each time,1
like to create one of my class I would just use classname(),0
does anyone works on pycharm? what boxes should I check?,0
but how do I loop this into creating like 50 objects in a loop,0

"@SFM61319 You can do```pyfrom __future__ import annotations```for delayed evaluation of annotations.Or if your version of Python is too low use strings (like `""Foo""`).",1

1. if a function returns `None` the annotation is `None` not `NoneType`2. No need to annotate `__init__`,0

@SFM61319 Well no need for it it's quite an obscure thing.,0

#ot1jake’schildleighbor pls help,0
@SFM61319 Also if it's an internal thing and you're using a type checker (like `mypy` or `pyright` (if not  why aren't you using them?)) you might not need that type check  it should be caught at typecheck time.,1
Lol,0
@SFM61319 Replace > `> NoneType` with `> None`.Whether you need those annotations or not is a separate question. Pylance (~= Pyright) will figure out that a function returns `None`  it's not rocket science; so you might not need that at all.,1

"editor = support with code syntax but not necessarily execution""IDE = editor plus code running and debugging and management tools",0
@ZukeSan not necessarily. VS Code isn't that hard to get up and running with. Links coming,0
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/pythontutorial,0
how do i practice python,0
@SFM61319 in `__init__.py` you add:```pyfrom algos import from dstructs import ```beware of course of name collisions,0
@SFM61319 you can also import name by name if import is too messy,0
@ZukeSan no worries this channel is for general questions like beginner Qs anyway,0
@SFM61319 try it see what happens,0
and that error is ... ?,0
(sorry but when people say it\'s got an error and don\'t say what the error is I want to throw my computer out the window),1
is there anything in `__init__.py` right now?,0
that's why,0
you'd have to say `from dsalgos import algos`,0
@SFM61319 what happens if you just say `import dsalgos`,0
and then use `dsalgos.algos`,0
does just `import dsalgos` work?,0
@SFM61319 wait those first two lines work?,0
@SFM61319 i mean isn't that more or less what you want?,0
so in other words this doesn't work:```pyfrom dsalgos import algosalgos.some_method()```,0
@SFM61319 ok now I am confused.,0
"where is this random file""?",0
well that's the thing  if you invoke a file somewhere at random in that tree the imports for that file are going to be deduced from the context of the imported file. If my entry point for a project is some file two folders down it doesn't automatically know about everything above it.,1
if you're creating what amounts to an installed library that you want to import anywhere in your project then you'd need to add its directory to the project's import path so it could resolve imports to it properly,1
you ... don't need to do that,0
it does but you dont need it,0
you can say `from .. import algos` to import from a superdirectory,0
yeah bc thats not the right syntax,0
but a: you shouldn't be using `__import__` for dynamic imports b: you dont need a dynamic import anyway,0
@ZukeSan what happened?,0
@nemesis is this supposed to convert that string into a list of lists?,0
@ZukeSan are you on Windows ?,0
"if so then `[list(row) for row in img.split(""\"")]` should work",0
@ZukeSan try this: `py m pip list` and paste what comes up,0
idek what your code is doing,0
but its inefficient,0
@ZukeSan er do that in the cmd line not in Python itself,0
"@nemesis `[list(row) for row in img.strip().split(""\"")] `",0
ok,0
let me simplify it,0
"```pythonrows = []for row in img.strip().split(""\""): rows.append(list(row))```",0
@ZukeSan what else came up? there should be a list of installed packages,0
str.split removes leading and trailing whitespace,0

fstrings are preferred for newer code but it's useful to know the older syntax for working with existing code,0
Why does it create a `__pycache__` for every subfolder that I create?,0
thats where cpython stores compiled bytecode(.pyc files),0
@Inheritance ♦ that's normal. Each of those folders contains a compiled version of the Python source in the folder above it so it doesn't have to do that every time that code is run,1
the python hash algo uses randomness right?,0

@SFM61319 read about proper git workflows,0
you can have ugly work in a branch then merge that branch with develop/master squashing all the commits into one,0
that way you don't really have to worry about your code being ugly while you develop it,0
@SFM61319 <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparingworkflows>,0
pretty good site,0
#helpcroissant someone help with d.py,0
every time you start working on a new feature you create a branch for that feature,0
if it's the first commit you can just add an empty readme really,0
"hey i need help with my code im trying to make a bot status which displays bot guilds and members (the total amount) however the guild total count is correct but the member count total in all guilds is wrong.. here is my code (i have it in a cog):```@commands.Cog.listener() async def on_connect(self): bot_guilds = len(self.client.guilds) bot_members = len(set(self.client.get_all_members())) await self.client.change_presence(activity = discord.Activity(name=f""{bot_guilds} Guilds & {bot_members} Members! | {os.environ.get(\'default_prefix\')}help type=discord.ActivityType.watching) status=discord.Status.online) ```",1
so you could have a branch `tree` a branch `dag` a branch `vector` etc and work independently on each of them as you need then once you are done with a feature you merge it into develop or master,1
that way your master stays clean and all that jazz but you can share the work in progress in the feature branches,1

"Well scripting language programming language etc. are very loosely defined terms like interpreted and compiled"".",0
exactly,0
I have no idea what you're arguing about tho,0
hence saying c++ is the best programming language <as opposed to> python is the best scripting language is an empty statement,1
not even mentioning about the fact that there is nothing that makes C++ or python the best at anything,0
and i'm telling you C++ is a scripting language too,0
because it can be interpreted,0
(now that's where someone who actually knows about C++ shows one of the many lines in the standard that says it isn't compliant if it's not compiled to machine code),1

thats a giant topic in and of itself,0

> java for example is typically compiled to jvm bytecode (or graal or whatever other vm) then said VM will interpret the bytecode> same with python the python code is (optionally) compiled to bytecode which is then in turn interpreted by the vm@lgneous by vm you mean the Python interpreter?,1
a sequence?,0
you can call it what you want the component in the cpython code that reads the bytecode and executes it accordingly,1
a scripting language and programming language have no clear boundary,0
Java is not considered a scripting language and works a very similar way as python,0
not rllyyou give a computer instructions,0
u have to compile python too,0
yeah..,0
every module except for your entry point get compiled to python bytecode,0
to bytecode,0
so java is a scripting language then,0
probably mostly yeah,0
^^java's code is interpreted afaik,0
but thats not a qualifier for scripting,0
you have to compile python to pyc,0
https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/compile.c,0
ytho lol,0
theres no reason 2,0
what do you think jvm bytecode is if not bytecode,0
Hey @! 𝑀𝒶𝓇𝒯𝒶𝓁𝒾𝓉𝓎!,0
there\'s really no point in trying to distinguish between scripting and programming language,0
in the end your giving a computer instructions,0
👍,0
isn't scripting and programming the same?,0
hm?,0
@!Y what is the difference?,0
the purpose of coding is to give a computer instructions,0
@!Y is Python a scripting language or a programming language?,0
no they don't,0
they don't tho,0
whats the different use cases,0
you guys should come in #ot2statuesicoflimitations where we are having a discussion related to that,0
sur,0
"@!Y how do you define scripting""?",0
Can someone dm me I need help with Python. Who every is really good at Python I need help,0
#❔｜howtogethelp,0
or just post your question here,0
Ok thx,0
Can someone dm me I need help with Python. Who every is really good at Python I need help,0
post your question here,0
How do I make a bot block out bad words and take away/add roles,0
@!Y it's hard to make a clear distinction then. which means the terms are misleading because they sounds distinct.,0
@!Y it's hard to make a clear distinction then. which means the terms are misleading because they sounds distinct.,0
Like let’s say I want to mute someone after they spam,0
How do I make the bot take away a role and give them a mute role,0
@styx that's pretty squishy too.,0
@!Y i don't think there is.,0
Is there certain commands I have to use when creating a discord bot,0
so Python is good for lots of things,0
How do I export my coding to make it a bot,0
??,0
they want to add a mute role,0
@styx is Python interpreted or compiled? And what about Java?,0
python is interpreted because its all done at runtime,0
java is compiled because some stuff(the compiling) is done prior to runtime,0
@hmmm Python and Java are executed the same: compiled to bytecode which is then interpreted.,0
do other interpeted languages use bytecode compilation?,0
@!Y I think it's misleading to overcategorize languages. We can use whole sentences (or paragraphs) instead of labels.,0
@escaleta sorry for the hair 🙂,0
"@!Y good for lots of things == scripting""?",0
@!Y my problem with scripting language is that it seems to limit Python to small things.,0
google it,0
every scripting lang is a programming lang,0
yo,0
@!Y except we can\'t seem to define scripting language,0
ok let\'s define it and get rid of scripting language as a label.,0
"few uses vs many uses""?",0
It seems to be what you were talking about,0
that could follow on from that.,0
wouldn't that apply to a lot of languages?,0
many uses is kinda vague,0
the def of good xD,0
Where do I start if I know nothing about python,0
,0
Thank u,0
dude,0
no,0
yeah,0
bro,0
dude stop,0
@legoshiwolf stop,0
no but the code is open source and you can host it yourself,0

take a look @julien,0
Hey someone know how i send a message to a webhook if my python program gets started?like a simple messageI need it for my bot,1
it's 19000  1.17 lol,0
you def learned that in school,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] it depends on what `something` is.,0
"`while : ` doesn\'t run the loop. `while hi"":` does run the loop.",0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] it still depends on what the value is.,0
how could it not depend on the value?,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] lots of diffeerent values can be considered true or false,0
i don't see how in that code something will always be true. it depends on what it is.,0
thank you.,0
what does that mean?,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] 0 is false 1 is true.  is false x is true,0
0 empty sets/dicts/lists and zerolength strings are false.,0
negative integers or floats are true though.,0
lol,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] what language are you describing? We are talking about Python.,0
Would the `is` operator in python be the same thing as javas `object.equals()` ?,0
You can also have a custom type (class) return true or false by overriding the `__bool__` method,0
@None4U thanks,0
> @nedbat > @nedbat this is in python?@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] Yes,0
@Deleted User `is` tests for object identity.,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] In Python: 0 and empty things are false.,0
0 is considered an empty integer yes,0
any nonempty string is true,0
It's not the type itself that's true or false but the value,0
It is considered true. It does not literally equal True,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] userdefined classes can decide how they are considered.,0
```pythonx = []if x == False: #this will not run. X does not literally equal false.```,0
yes.,0
yes,0
as long as `something` evaluates to `True` yes.,0
why do you keep saying something without defining it?,0
correct,0
it depends what it is.,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] `something = ` the loop won\'t run,0
the value of it is what's important. If the value of `something` evaluates to `True` the loop will run. Otherwise it won't.,1
sorry if this is out of topic. but how do you spell femael,0
ok thanks,0
huh,0
fimale or female,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] you can play around with it by using the bool() method,0
like ```pythonx = []print(bool(x))```,0
...,0
ok,0

Hello,0
So i have been learning Python today and im basically a beginner someone teached me this:,0
"a = input (""Hi"")if 1: a == Hello"" while 1: print(""Welcome back!"") break  b = input (""Are you feeling good today?"") if 1: b == Yes"" if 1: print (""I\'m so glad to hear that!"")",1
Hey @Deleted User!,0
"```pythona = input (""Hi"")if 1: a == Hello"" while 1: print(""Welcome back!"") break  b = input (""Are you feeling good today?"") if 1: b == Yes"" if 1: print (""I\'m so glad to hear that!"")```",1
I did this i would like to create a interactive bot and i need help,0
@Deleted User use one of the open help channels for a project,0
k,0
why are you using `if 1`,0
he is a beginner and got it from someone else,0
the real question is why did someone else use if 1: lol,0
@Cyber wdym and where is the help channel,0
wait were you the person who asked how to collapse the code in python,0
@Deleted User there are two open help channels #helpchestnut #helpcarrot,0
@GHOUL use a help channel,0
,0
personally I took an introductory course through my school. The rest I learned from this python discord while i made several long projects,1
this server is an invaluable resource for coding,0
@Deleted User Someone teached me Python a little and thats how i made the code,0
Once you understand intro to python you can just figure out projects to make.,0
I started with small ones eventually discord bots where I learned OOP,0
not `get.event_loop` but `get_event_loop`,0
They changed it?,0
no...,0
it works with the . on my other code.,0
@Cyber just do 30 minutes a day,0
ngl those kinds of courses are not good,0
@zHaq selfbotting is against discord TOS btw,0
im using https://onlinepython.com tho,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan they aren't that bad gives a general idea of programming and how it works,0
🤔 they're against tos though @Deleted User,0
no not the bots,0
@cdboy it\'s hard to avoid return,0
ah ok that makes more sense,0
too bad it might get your account banned,0
they'll never know 👀,0
sure,0
no,0
> You have to admit it's fun tho spamming a count channel xD@zHaq why do bad things when you could do good things?,1

@DARKEVIL stop it,0
@DARKEVIL can you not spam please,0
@SFM61319 start with pytest,0
(instead of unittest...),0
pytest is essentially unittest but pythonic,0
you don't need to bump your channel someone will take a look at it if they have the time,0
@The Happy Reddit don't,0
that's...strange,0
a simple way is a test_foo.py file for each foo.py file,0
no,0
ideally `__init__.py` doesn't contain any logic,0
therefore doesn't need tests,0
in fact ideally `__init__.py` is empty,0
why is there someone spamming a channel,0
xD,0
DM @Python Discord ModMail,0
bruh moment,0
`return` ?,0
what is your current code ? and what are you trying to do exactly ?,0
it applies the bottom one first iirc,0
```pyclass test: def __init__(self): del self```,0
```py@dec_1@dec_2def func(): ...````dec_2` wraps `func` and then `dec_1` wraps `dec_2`,0
you should pretend relative imports don't exist,0
use absolute imports for everything,0
in `tests/test_module.py````pyimport lib.module# testing code here```,0
what kind of software development though,0
it's the same thing modulo the headaches of relative imports,0
python's import system is so awful,0
No but add text to know what each test case is doing,0
that is documentation then,0
"no `assert expr x is 12""`",0
yes,0
if you think you're paid based on the difficulty of your work i have some bad news,0
is that like filsystem stuff,0
`asyncio.leep`,0
`self.status()`,0
@Deleted User `self.status()`,0
you have to be more specific than that,0
`self.status()` in `on_connect`,0
do you mean file IO or filesystem stuff,0
instead of status(),0
and you misspelled asyncio.sleep,0
> Demand for wizard level C programmers is low but supply is even lower so pay is high.not in my experience,1
instead of status(),0
ye,0
oh ye,0
and status needs a `self` param,0
https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technologywhatlanguagesareassociatedwiththehighestsalariesworldwide same here,0
C is at the bottom Python is up here,0
demand for c is low,0
Sure that's true,0
But even my anecdotal sample of like 7 people the JS ppl are the highest paid ones,0
https://i.imgur.com/kEa8UIO.png can someone help me here? The code works but whenever I set (x y) vector it highlights on pycharm,0
@kendalk08 ah okay ill just use the default fixes than,0
methods need a self parameter,0
you have `async def status()`,0
oh,0
it's the problem,0
async def status(self)?,0
yes,0
ok,0
he's referring to `self` in the method which isn't bound,0
the whole code is indented,0
i doubt he's defining functions in a while loop,0
I\'d rather fix problems quickly than have to read through 10k lines just in case,0
"def list_xor(n list1 list2): return (n in list1) ^ (n in list2)""what does ^ do?",0
it's xor,0
as in ```pyTrue ^ True == FalseTrue ^ False == TrueFalse ^ True == TrueFalse ^ False == False```,0
the function checks that `n` is in exactly one of `list1` and `list2`,0
oh thx,0
thats weird,0
is there a `switch` equivalent in python?,0
nice,0
it's sensibly the same i'd use the first one because it's a bit more obvious that the keys and values are the same @Spyder,1
argh,0
sorry spyder,0
have you seen chef?,0
how would you tell the python interpreter which file you want to run,0
you can use batch files or directly use the command line,0
it can be anything that is in the PATH,0
it's just generally better to specify the entire path in case someone overrides what the program points to,0
so far that's correct,0
`func(arg1=1 arg2=2)`,0
argument,0
:hyperlemon:,0
yep,0
https://tenor.com/view/slaponlineinternetcomputergif8180219,0
when i get code wrong,0
convert to string maybe,0
and use `kwargs`,0
yes but no,0
`str` would be better,0
`chr(0) != 0'`,0
```pydef func(kwargs): print(kwargs)func({str(i): i for i in range(10)})```,0
run that,0
uh no ?,0
why q ?,0
yes but it's not done directly that way,0
instead see `foo(bar=1)` as `foo({'bar':1})` not the opposite,0
#webdevelopment,0
why doesn't this work properly for making a sudoku square?```pyimport randomchoices = [                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]square = linecount = 0for i in range(9): if linecount == 3: square += f'{random.choice(choices)} \' linecount = 0 else: square += f'{random.choice(choices)}  linecount += 1print(square)```,1
no @SFM61319 because functions are expressions and `assert` isn't,0
you can't do `print(assert)`,0
you can do `print(print)`,0
5 1 2 4,0
the other 2 lines are blank,0
it works sometimes,0
!eprint(print),0
@✪ SavagePastaMan :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```<builtin function print>```,0
it shows like `<builtin function print'>`,0
but not always,0
why not,0
x x x 8x 6 xx x,0
this is what i got,0
why are you using `print` and not `sys.stdout.write`,0
anyone know how i would return the amount of people in a server,0
almost,0
i was thinking guild.member_count,0
doesnt seem to work,0
you don't have `sep` and `end` with `.write`,0
you also can't buffer your output or rather you have to specifically call `flush` rather than do `flush=True` in print,0
now i got this lolx x x x8 x 1 1x,0
xxxxx9966did u mean`if linecount > 3` ?,0
@SFM61319 the 72 char limit is ignored by most people anyway,0
set up your linter to use 100 or 120 or something and stick to it even in tests,0
ayy worked,0
thanks a lot @LightSpdRunner,0
https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/54137,0
> If you want to make it look more normal you could start `linecount = 1` and then check for `linecount == 3`. But if you start at zero you only go up to 2.@LightSpdRunner tried that and didn't work anyways i'm already happy with it,1
wdym in 2 places,0
oh in the beginning too,0
imma try that,0
yeah worked,0
then it'd be row not column?,0
ah,0
can u put a for loop inside a for loop?,0
> Systemwide keypress?@zHaq pygame maybe? seems like a pretty universal module to me but not the fastest way to detect them ig,1
why am i getting this error?``` for i in range(9): ^IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level```,0
```pyfor c in range(9): squares[c] =  var = c for i in range(9): if linecount == 3: squares[var] += f'{random.choice(choices)} \' linecount = 1 else:  squares[var] += f'{random.choice(choices)}  linecount += 1```,1
worked now,0
tabs and spaces but it normally shows a different error for that,0
can you do `tree` at the root of your git repo,0
```shproject package __init__.py module.py tests __init__.py test_module.py```this is the rough structure you should have,0
`project` is the cloned git folder,0
are you on windows ?,0
no i meant just `tree`,0
but leave it if you're on windows,0
idk if it exists there,0
wait it does,0
`tree /f` apparently,0
yeah gotta ignore the pycaches,0
```.│ .gitignore│ LICENSE│ README.org│ setup.py│├───lampy│ │ core.py│ │ stream.py│ │ __init__.py│ ││ └───std│ std.py│ __init__.py│└───test test_const.py test_identity.py __init__.py```your structure should look like this,1
did you build the project with setup.py ?,0
you can't run tests if you can't build your project,0
you should be able to `pip install .` or `python m setup install` either way,0
no but you should make a basic `setup.py` before you even get started with the project,0
then build the project,0
building just means making the project runnable,0
which can then in turn be used by the tests,0
https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/goodpractices.html#testsoutsideapplicationcode,0
(you can ignore the pytest specific),0
no no no,0
well `pip install`/`python setup install` will do it for you,0
`pip install .` `.` here means the current directory,0
you can/should specify `e` too,0
so that if you edit the source code you don't have to build it again,0
means editable,0

for loops in java are so strange they are more like a shortened way to write a while loop,0
🤔,0
because you're used to python loops,0
yea,0
java also has for each loops,0
seems I haven't gotten there yet then,0
right,0
that's one of the major stumbling blocks for people learning python after a lang with cstyle loops,0
@dewi you can just call `np.array` on any list with homogeneous dimensions,0

do you guys think taking a kinematic course will help me with understanding basic movement for games?,0
It may help you make the game more cinematic,0
@Vestergurkan for example i want to make a racing 2d game but not sure how to curve the player,0
so would that help with that,0
thats what I tried,0
"What do you mean by curve the player""?",0
yes lmao,0
like a car goes straight but it can also curve turn right,0
its just me and 2 other bots I made,0
yes,0
yes,0
im watching a vid on it real quick,0
@Ovicron If you're just talking about programming it knowing cinematography won't help. If you know how to program it but want it to look almost like a movie cinematography may help. I think it's a lot about studying how other games do it though even if a course like that may help as well,1
@Vestergurkan ahh got it thank you,0
Nice nice. Good luck with the game,0
😄 thanks,0
loaded but not working,0
oops sorry,0
no im still watching a vid on it,0
ill figure it out dw,0
:/,0
the only other bots ive made wont even turn on lmao,0
@Vedran If I ever have csv or excel data I much prefer the actual analysis and manipulation of it in pandas,1
so im hoping this will work,0
cause all my other bots i sorta just guessed what to do,0
I don't think so. It's much easier for me to load it in and quickly query specific column names and have functions that do analysis on lots of different data.,1
obviously it depends on the end goal and the user,0
most people that use excel heavily don't write code as their primary activity,0
It's also much easier for me to look at subset and filtered data and looking at how things behave stepbystep,0
If I have anything above 20k lines I am definitely NOT using excel,0
and if you plan on passing the data to python later on doing it in pandas makes a lot more sense too,1
If it's something fast or a quick plot I'll still use excel but if it's process I want repeated or I need to do a deep dive into data it's so much easier in pandas,1
I'll typically actually pull subset data in pandas fire it off to an excel file so my coworkers can quickly graph and do their own stuff with it. That type of subset and saving behaviour would be a bit more tedious in excel,1
i'm sure if you were as efficient in excel as you are in python you'd say the opposite,0
No I'm fairly comfortable in excel and write my own macros. It is easier with python and pandas though.,0
Python program to filter and grab subsets of data and save to a network location with specific names so my coworkers can start building reports is much easier and faster to do than writing an excel macro for it.,1
I still prefer excel for graphing though unless it's going in a report :lemon_sweat:,0
how do i get help lol,0
@Deleted User check out #❔｜howtogethelp to grab your own help channel,0
Yeah I usually end up having a looot of subplots if I want to look at a bunch of data at once,1
I think it's a bit of a drawback where it's trying to emulate matlab a bit too much imo. There are ways around it but none work flawlessly and always feel a bit hacky,1
aaah yeah. In that case you just want the graphs to pop up and for the code to keep executing?,0
Have you checked out mpl's interactive mode `ion()`?,0
yes,0
what,0
> I still prefer excel for graphing though unless it's going in a report :lemon_sweat:@kutiekatj9 how?>,0
i haven't touched mpl in years,0
graphing with pandas is stupid simple,0
and i'm so glad,0
I think you can also do `.show(block=False)` but that breaks down in loops,0
@Melen how I prefer graphing in excel vs matplotlib?,0
that's the whole purpose of tensorboard logging stuff including images graphs distributions histograms etc,0
If youre already using Pandas to process why not for graphing too? Graphing with pandas is ezpz,0
@Melen aaaah it's mainly because of my coworkers. They are only comfortable in excel and they often like graphs formatted in the excelstyle. So it's a bit of a habit for me to do my heavy analysis in pandas `.to_excel()` it and then graph there so my coworkers can take a look a bit easier.,1

Feel free to ask for code reviews in a help channel. Check out #❔｜howtogethelp,0
it's implied @SοmeDude,0
@Vestergurkan awesome. Thanks!,0
`Optional[T]` doesn't mean it can be omitted in the list of argument btw it means it can be either None or a value of type T,1
you don't need to but it can be used to document and used by external tools to statically check if your program is valid,1
It really makes the code so much cleaner and more understandable,0
i'd say it depends to be fair we're definitely going in the right direction with newer updates to `typing` and types in general but if you're type hinting 3.5 code the available tools are pretty unexpressive and verbose,1
Of course. I’m referring to development using the uptodate versions,0
@SοmeDude It makes the most sense in larger projects. For smaller oneoff things you don't need it. And in many cases if your code's reasonably clean modern linters can infer types,1
@SοmeDude one pitfall: programmers often like the gamification that comes from running a checker and having it tell you you passed. Then they decide they have to typeannotate everything. You can add annotations to some things and get some benefit. it's not all or nothing.,1
it's best for things where you have a lot of potential complexity in terms of what components talk to what other components,1

can i ask simple questions that wouldnt be worth using python help here?,0
> ughh why cant i use a list as a key in a dictionary?@Mick keys have to be immutable,0
that is literally true.,0
Hey @itsthat0neguy!,0
objects can be immutable.,0
well if you want to be pedantic about it,0
dicts cannot contain any object with a hash that will change over its lifetime,0
but considering the language used by the CPython docs...,0
,0
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries,0
Hey @itsthat0neguy!,0
> Unlike sequences which are indexed by a range of numbers dictionaries are indexed by keys which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings numbers or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly it cannot be used as a key.,1
...I think it is acceptable shorthand to say keys must be immutable.,0
you cant,0
split it into multiple messages,0
Is anyone here really good at pyqt5? I really need help with a pretty specific question,0
it literally is not.,0
```py>>> class A:... pass... >>> a = A()>>> hash(a)8791961957381>>> id(a)140671391318096```,0
AND,0
LoL,0
^,0
Hey @itsthat0neguy!,0
> the hash of an object is just its `id` why cant that be the same for lists?@Mick if you do this you end up with JS `Map`,1
> but objects are mutable why are they allowed as keys?@Mick because as I said above it's not really about mutability but about whether the hash changes over the lifetime of the object,1
there's no way to know if an object is mutable or not @Mick,0
we just assume it is if `hash != None` and doesn't throw an exception,0
> Just moved my venv to my server and for some reason on my server it can't find `./bin/python3.8` within my venv folder anybody know why this might be?@aٴ You can't move venvs. you recreate them. (btw maybe pick a name people can see....),1
> i dun like these rules... it makes me want to make classes where simple lists do just fine@Mick there are reasons for the rules.,1
@Mick you can make a class with a list and make it usable as a key if you want.,0
if you want a hashable list look into tuples,0
data structures like most other things have to follow the laws of physics.,0
it's probably a better fit,0
and I would guess that if you have to fight this restriction you need a partial redesign,0
then you can't use it as a key,0
it will break if you do so,0
@Mick do you understand the danger of using a list as a key?,0
probably not,0
@Mick but in general you see the danger.,0
OK that's why lists can't be keys.,0
like I said...redesign.,0
@Mick if you have lists you want to use as keys just turn them into tuples,0
if you need the list to be mutable then there is a danger in your code,0
> redesign redesign... more like reimplement dictionaries@Mick redesign your code.,0
you definitely don't have to reimplement dicts,0
the Python `dict` implementation works just fine in general.,0
@Mick that's fine.,0
or just make a wrapper class,0
defo better than the hell that is JS `Map`,0
tuples are only hashable if their contents are hashable right?,0
yes,0
ye,0
is there any other way?,0
🥴,0
yes you can,0
,0
why not?,0
@Mick you want to make a list an element of itself?,0
if you mean recursive `tuple` in the sense of `tuple` that contains itself then no,0
what are these lists? Tell us more.,0
> is it possible to have 2 exceptions?> try:> except:> except:?@L (UwU) rker ```pytry: ...except TypeError: ...except Exception: ...```,0
> if you mean recursive `tuple` in the sense of `tuple` that contains itself then no@gm at least not without a fair bit of magic,1
0 to 9 inclusive,0
@Mick can you tell us what these lists represent?,0
> `randrange (0 10)`> Can that also be 0 and 10 or just 1234 ... 89?@KA11I `randrange` is not inclusive of the endpoint like `range`; `randint` is.,1
@Pidge does the re.split code work for you?,0
yes,0
it's like `range` hence the name,0
> @nedbat some element in a video game basically this:> essences are just `(name: str rarity: str)`> confluences are just `(name:str (essence essence essence))`> however what i need is to provide the ability from each essence to find all the confluences it is a part of and basically allow full searching on this> > the way i designed it is by having the essences contain lists of all the combinations theyre a part of(combination being the 2nd element of a confluence)> edit: also the names and rarity attributes need to be mutable!@Mick does changing the name and rarity affect which combinations an essence is a part of?,1
okay,0
do confluences change?,0
yup,0
but identity of both essences and confluences are set right?,0
i.e. once one is created links don't change,0
so what's your existing implementation of essences and confluences,0
simple classes?,0
> Are the projects on pypi safe to install?> https://pypi.org/project/MusicalBeeps/> Has anyone used this site before?@Urkchar PyPI is more or less where you get everything.,1
"> ```py> with open(""chat.json w"") as load_chat:> json.dump(chat load_chat indent=4)> ``` why am i getting invalid syntax?@kendalk08 check the lines before that",1
you're missing `:`,0
pep8 is crying,0
> you're missing `:`@lgneous the original code has it,0
,0
stack traces don't remove characters,0
also you can use `Typing` to annotate the contents of the list too,0
@Mick use classes,0
press control + s,0
@kendalk08 can you link us to the full code?,0
and have a `dict` which maps each `Essence` to a `list` of `Combinations`,0
it's literally like 2 lines of extra code,0
wonder if that's lemon,0
> not really not if i include all the other nonsense that is required... its more like 60~ lines of code@Mick like what?,1
what is there that would need to be in a class that you wouldn't have to write anyway,0
+ this is literally a situation where keys should not be mutable because the names can change,0
and the idiomatic way to create an object whose hash doesn't change even if it has a mutable attribute is...a class,1
actually use a `set` not a `list`,0
> @gm taking several essences and finding common confluences they all share for example@Mick shared = set(chain.from_iterable(essence.combinations for essence in [essence_1 essence_2 essence_3])),1
> @gm you just said i should have the combinations in a different dict@Mick no that's for lookup of which combinations each essence is in,1
which you can have as a class attribute on `Essence` if you really want I guess,0
why would it be recursive,0
oh the nice thing about that (well depending on how you look at it) is that you can autopopulate it when you create a new combination too,1
Have you tried attrs or dataclasses?,0
I'm p sure it's 1 line between methods...?,0
it's one line,0
ideally you would have a third class that handles this kind of thing,0
so as to decouple `Essence` and `Confluence`,0
I quite like the design TBH,0
actually not necessarily...depends on where you put your stuff.,0
have you tried mypy?,0
```pyclass Confluence: essence_finder = defaultdict(set) def __init__(self name: str essences: Essence): self._name = name self._essences = essences for essence in essences: essence_finder[essence].add(self)```,1
ngl if you use `list` instead of `List[whatever]` that's not too surprising,0
> no... i literally only use standard libraries xD@Mick Why would you do that?,0
You didn't write your own programming language,0
Why not use libraries?,0
> You didn't write your own programming language@nedbat this is true...but it's a different skillset.,0
I like reimplementing stuff too,0
Did you implement a static typechecker?,0
plus I think in this case there's a legitimate reason for wanting to do stuff by oneself,0
it's not a productiongrade project is it?,0
`attrs` could,0
to write a program from scratch you must first create your own universe or something,0
@Mick you complained about the lack of static type checking. seems like you want it.,0
> to write a program from scratch you must first create your own universe or something@✪ SavagePastaMan not difficult in functional languages where functions take universes and return new universes,1
then go use Haskell,0
ah yes good old butterfly something something,0
You want type checking in python. Use mypy,0
where's that xkcd,0
it's silly to limit yourself to no libraries.,0
^ if you're writing production code,0
if you want to implement somehting yourself fine. But if you aren't going to implement it you can use someone elses.,1
You said you missed the static typing.,0
+ one of the main draws (for many people) of Python is dynamic typing so 🤷\u200d♂️,0
but yes I do agree having `data` is nice...,0
good,0
anyway to go back to the original problem yeah I don't see why you need mutable keys,0
not sure why you avoid libraries,0
you don't even reallly need a class for that TBH,0
you can do it procedurally if you want but then you'd have a global variable,0
which I think is ickier,0
python with no libraries...,0
doesnt that limit to console apps?,0
incidentally do all confluences contain 3 essences?,0
@Mick to be fair you said no... i literally only use standard libraries which sounds like you avoid thirdparty libraries.,0
oh well.,0
not much of a difference in the long run,0
I liked solving this problem though,0
thanks for bringing it up,0
ok but you can understand our confusion,0
wonder if I can build something with it...,0
most haskell people using Python jump at mypy,0
> most haskell people using Python jump at mypy@nedbat really...?,0
I mean...lots of stuff that you can do in Haskell you can't do (or do well) in Python,0
> @gm i enjoyed it too... up till the point people started requesting more features ;;@Mick not sure about you but personally I love realising that business needs make all the designs you've written obsolete and having to clunk together something really ugly,1
i 💀,0
like something as basic as function types: `Callable[[int] str] > bool` vs `Int > String > Bool` (Haskell) or `(Int String) > Boolean` (Scala),1
now with protocols we can have something closer to haskell,0
performance slows down like 0.1 seconds if its an app just for you that’s literally almost nothing,0
my point is: if you like haskell but use python you probably want to use mypy,0
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0544/ protocols,0
then you should use classes 🙂,0
🤔,0
> help me out I'm kinda dumbstruck right now (2.30 am)  I've used time.time() to find out how many seconds my program takes to do its job but I get something like this `1602289409.4994128` back. if that's seconds I've no clue how to read it :<@marc it's seconds since the epoch,1
call it once at the start once at the end and subtract the two,0
which is like december 1970 i think,0
1 January I think,0
but yeah 1970,0

you could also use `datetime`,0

simple enough?,0

Stop:5/Percy St/Waterdale Rd /Heidelberg WestStop:6/Waterdale Rd/Dougharty Rd /Heidelberg WestStop:7/Kolora Rd/Dougharty Rd /Heidelberg WestStop:8/Ramu Pde/Oriel Rd /Heidelberg WestStop:9/Outhwaite Rd/Oriel Rd /Heidelberg WestStop:10/Morobe St/Oriel Rd /Heidelberg West,1
btw the text file is basically that format,0
Hmm.... I remember that module but I totally forgot what is it for?,0
repr,0
ooh right,0
Than there is a few others one,0
Yeah,0
i'm not sure if you guys understand my goal here ahha,0
Right i remember now,0
How to make re `.` match `\` also,0
The function lists all the stops in the requested range. For example if startis 5 and end is 10 the output should look like this:,1
```pythonStop:5/Percy St/Waterdale Rd /Heidelberg WestStop:6/Waterdale Rd/Dougharty Rd /Heidelberg WestStop:7/Kolora Rd/Dougharty Rd /Heidelberg WestStop:8/Ramu Pde/Oriel Rd /Heidelberg WestStop:9/Outhwaite Rd/Oriel Rd /Heidelberg WestStop:10/Morobe St/Oriel Rd /Heidelberg West```,1
hmm,0
So what exactly does the _repr_ method do,0
@Jac_k i think that helps a lot actually lemme try this again,0
@sfdsf I see... so when are they useful to use?,0
repr just lets you define a custom string to `represent` your object,0
Make sense,0
so that when you print it you see the string instead of main.__object@ram,0
👍,0
its in the name `repr` lol,0
i have a weird symbol on my pycharm...,0
screenshot it,0
,0
It could be that cat on lesser_noob pfp loll,0
that blue thing on line 8,0
i think you could hover your mouse on it,0
it wants me to put that code before the init funciton?,0
but it is under it...,0
,0
click on it and see what it does then,0
you could always ctrl z later lol,0
it opened a new tab of bulletins....,0
I think you should just ignore it,0
what does it say when you hover your mouse over the blue thing?,0
ah,0
hmm i think i need to change the name...,0
i changed it to self.name self.number etc,0
@Deleted User Those are the right way to call it,0
you always have to use self.,0
I think there was something like 0 means your code is successfully executed whereas 1 means there is a problem,0
not sure,0
dict is not necessarily indexed by numbers,0
thats kinda wrong way to use if statement lol,0
Cuz it's not clearly telling what to do,0
can someone give me some more help in the vc help room plz? i'm a bit lost,0
it is just if arcondition:,0
i hate to sound needy,0

Hey @Oli3R!,0
O..O what is your question?,0
"@Oli3R ```pythonmissing_letter = (""The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"")print(missing_letter.casefold())``` I just tried this simple way and it worked",1
how can I switch the keys and values of a dictionary?,0
Do you have any code that you would like to show?,0
"```pyfor d in alldicts: for k v in d.items(): print(emoji v) if emoji is v:  target = k print(""SUCCESS"") break```this isn\'t working even tho I can see they visually match",1
So i was curious if I could just invert the values of the dict then just call on the emoji to get the value of the channel name,1
You can easily do it by writing this one line code `dict = {value:key for key value in dict.items()}`,0
kk,0
If you wanna try an example then here is a good one,0
"```pythonprint(""original"")dict = {\'a\': 1 \'b\': 2 \'c\': 3}print(dict)print(""Swap"")dict = {value:key for key value in dict.items()}print(dict)```",0

getting this issue while deploying discord bot on heroku,0
i can provide Procfile tho,0
@Deleted User surely they used an app for doing that or created one.,0
Really cool,0
Click it,0
and select your interpreter,0
you have to rely on the internal clock for `wait`,0
meaning you have to interface with lower level languages to do that which already implement `sleep` and such,0
store the value of previous iteration in a variable then use `==` and `break`,0
it exits the innermost loop,0
you can't compare numpy arrays like that,0
use `np.array_equal`,0
@𝔹𝕒𝕕𝕞𝕒𝕤𝕙 what about the other one check AP?,0
@𝔹𝕒𝕕𝕞𝕒𝕤𝕙 20 minutes left quick,0
All python packages are opensource so you can check any of them @CrashAndSideburns,0

how to change the response status on flask,0
@Deleted User What code do you want it to be tho?,0
on the view function,0
response code,0
yes,0
Again  what response code do you want it to be? 😆,0
404,0
use abort,0
how?,0
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/patterns/errorpages/,0
its for api ._.,0
It's for anything,0
like when u access localhost:5000/item/dirt it doesn't exists then return code 404,0
but /item/lava exists so it return 200,0
> It's for anything@Doctor,0
kk,0
Just define your handler for 404 error,0
also i only want it for 1 not global,0
abort() raise the exception not the response i want,0
Then return response status_code,0
ah,0
ok thanks,0
@manalan https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html#gc.collect,0
It collects all objects without references to them,0
?,0
@manalan Python garbage collecting works by counting references to the objects,0
When object reference count hits 0 it's marked for deletion,0
why i always get index out of range but when i check the list i see 1 item,0
i do List[0] on a list with only 1 item,0
@manalan gc.collect forces python gc to delete these objects immediately on call,0
You shouldn't really use it 🙂,0
,0
the upper one is when i do str(list) the latter is list[0],0
am i dumb or missing something,0
@Deleted User if it throws IndexError maybe list is empty?,0
@manalan show me the structure of list please,0
,0
when i print list[0],0
show full stacktrace then,0
,0
wgm,0
ehm code than? :d,0
code?,0
yep,0
"```py@app.route(""/item/<item_name>/icon"")def item(item_name): resp = requests.get(item_url+item_name) soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(resp.text,""html.parser"") icon = soup.findAll(""img"",class_=\'openInformation\') return icon[0]```",0
uhm can you return lists with flask?,0
no,0
so that's what you're trying to do,0
you have to either jsonify it,0
lemme try str(icon[0]),0
oh hey weird,0
i like how the error said index out of range but actually its type problem,0
thanks doctor,0
np,0
How is it related to python?,0
oh it was same for me too,0
+1,0
> When object reference count hits 0 it\'s marked for deletion@Doctor ref counting doesn\'t need to mark for deletion it directly deletes the object `gc.collect` is for the generational collector which collects dead cyclical references,1
@lgneous I didn't really get into how gc in python works. Nice to know tho,0
you were probably thinking of `markandsweep` in your first message which is one of the most common family of garbage collectorreferencing counting which python uses is actually very rarely used by other languages,1
i'm guessing he's a youtuber and these courses are paid,0
in which case a loud no would be my answer,0
@lgneous Yep i was thinking about something similar.I just didn't know that python immediately deletes objects when they have no references,1

Python Help: Available,0
Hello in PyExe when you convert your python program in to a executable you're compiling to C right? So if I have a python executable but I don't have python installed in my computer it doesn't matter since it will open anyways?,1
can i get help?,0
#helpdonut,0
You can but there is no one to help you right now.,0
Wasn't talking to you @Berla,0
I'm sure you can but I don't use windows anymore sorry,0
It really isn't,0
nearly everything in python is an object,0
Maybe that's confusing for you,0
No it isn't confusing to create your object is pretty simple compared to other languages.,0
@Deleted User if you're referring to py2exe PyInstaller and similar tools they don't compile to C they bundle the interpreter along with the source code in an executable,1
Like java that you have to define static public and other things I don\'t wanna remember,0
I'm also new in Python but maybe you need time to feer comfortable using the language.,0
@lgneous Oh so if you don't have Python you can still run the program,0
you can because the executable contains a python interpreter,0
show us the code first),0
Because clearly 6 isn't in first array,0
code?,0
@Xen i don't have much time rn,0
but you can compare these lists using a set,0
why do u type No or no does your teacher gives u that the user must input no or No? @Yeetee,1

"@Yeetee you can check this code you can learn from it.```#dice roll codeimport randomdice1= \'\'dice2= \'\'dice3= \'\'dice4= \'\'stats = {print(dice1,dice2,dice3,dice4)}gameStart = input(""Would you like to roll the dice?"")def diceRoll(): print(""Your number is:  + str(random.randint(1,6))) global play_again play_again = input(""Would you like to play again?"")if gameStart == yes"": diceRoll() if play_again == yes"": while play_again == yes"": diceRoll() else: print(""Game Over"") print(stats) else: print(""Game Over"") print(stats)elif gameStart == no"": print(""Game Over"") print(stats)else: print(""Input not recognized"")```",1

What do you mean @manalan,0
Explain your problem.,0
`eval()` is very insecure don\'t use it on inputs that are not trusted,0
Then `eval()` is your way to go but don't ever try putting your code in the web since they could inyect malicious code if you don't know how to properly configure it.,1
Sure,0
is there anyways in python to know if a site is a get or a post req site?,0
"If you want to use `eval()` then you surely need the user to input the string that is going to be evaluated.If you use `eval()` in your code you have to be very cautelous because if you don\'t properly sanitize your input someone could input a string like `""__import__(\'subprocess\').getoutput(\'rm rf ~\')""` that will remove all your files.Probably I commited misspelling errors that maybe made you feel confused so heres a webpage that talks about it.https://diveintopython3.net/advancediterators.html`eval() is evil`  That section.@manalan",1
> is there anyways in python to know if a site is a get or a post req site?like without actually manually figuring out?,1
anyone?,0
👍 remember that string is one of a lot more cases that can break your code or the server where you're hosting it.,1
Be sure if there isn't another option,0
Stop copy pasting the same question and use a help channel,0

How do you report someone?,0
🧐,0
#code mean the code... Literally anything,0

but n isn't a function 🙂,0
either use for loop or break keyword,0
use `for` if you want to repeat it certain amount of times,0

Hi all! I'd like to create objects of a class in a loop and appending them and their attributes to a dictionnary but I dont know how to use syntax properly please help!```animals = {}for i in range(3): animal(i) animals.update([i]:[animal.size animal.strength])print(animals)```,1
@Deleted User animals[KEY] = element,0
also consider creating an empty dict like so: ` animals = dict()`,0
```AttributeError: type object animal has no attribute size'```,0
I got this error 😦,0
yep. because you didn't create object of you calss,0
Class. Could i get full code?,0
doesnt animal(i) create an object ?,0
yes,0
Yes but you didn't assign it to any variable/ store anywhere.,0
"```class animal: def __init__(self,id): self.id = id self.size = random.randint(0,10) self.strength= self.size+random.randint(0,5) def __repr__(self): return f {self.id} {self.size} {self.strenght}""animals = {}for i in range(3): animal(i) animals[i]=[animal.size animal.strength]```",1
So it just got deleted instantly,0
Name classes in CamelCase so you can easily distinct them from variables,0
so this one would be `Animal`,0
the upper case matter ?,0
I dont really understand sorry lol,0
PEP8,0
Yep pep8 is a python code style guide. You should follow it.,0
It clearly says that you have to name classes in CamelCase,0
Again  just so you can distinct them from everything else. It doesn't `make sense` for python but does for you and another devs,1
ooh okay,0
it worked @L3viathan thanks a lot,0
thanks yall I'll try to,0
@L3viathan but dont all of my animal will be called animal then ? in my loop ?,0
it may cause problem ?,0
instead of a dict ?,0
ive tried a list but it didnt worked well,0
in fact I'd like to store the attributes so I can put them ultimately into a dataframe with attributes being in different columns. When I tried a list the repr pasted my attributes but python made it like it was all in one single columns 😦,1

Hey guys so I generated objects of a class into a dictionary with their attribute in a loop like that ```animals = dict()for i in range(3): animal = Animal(i) animals[i]=[animal.size animal.strength animal.power]```But now I'd like to select 2 of these animals and as input into a function ```def function(animal1 animal2)``` but in the loop they are only named ```animal=Animal(i)```. How can I refer to a specific one ?PLEASE HELP ❤️,1
,0
@zeeshanok can you be more clear please liek with a code example ? idk technical terms much,0
but I'm generating animals in a loop so I can generate big numbers is there a way to put this naming in the loop so they all refered with their ids ?,1
Hell,0
Hello,0
Can I ask question,0
Can I ask question,0
can i make with python desktop App ? And whic framework,0
```animalslist = []for i in range(3): animal = Animal(i) animals.append(animal)```Can I do that in the loop guys like a way to do animal[i]= Animal(i) so it generate the animal name with the number id in the loop ??,1
```pyanimalslist = ['dog cat horse']animals = []for i in range(3): animal = animalslist[i] animals.append(animal)```,0
🏃\u200d♂️,0
@Deleted User yea sorry I change dthe name of the list after all but forgot to change it in the loop,1
👍,0
```animalslist = []for i in range(3): animal = Animal(i) animalslist.append(animal)```,0
You are not allowed to use that command here. Please use the #botcommands channel instead.,0
is there a way I can create a name ```animali``` for animal=Animal(i) where the name takes the id value i,0
in my loop ?,0
Well you'd need to create a function as you're calling nothing,0
```pythondef Animal(x): return animalslist[x]```,0
But I don't see why you cant just directly get it from `animalslist`,0
in fact I want to select 2 specifics animal of the list in a subsequent function ( animal1 animal2) but since in my loop I say ```animal= Animal(i)``` I fear that all my animal are called animal ?,1
x = 10x = x + 10x = x – 5print(x)x y = x 2 22print(x y),0
can someone tell me whats wrong in this code  i m a begginner to python,0
@Deleted User No...,0
It'll work fine lol,0
how do I refer to a specific animal in the list then?,0
@Deleted User could you send your current code please?!,0
Using indexes or a dict,0
I actually have a dict also lol lemme share you my full code,0
And yes ^ you can access elements of a list by index,0
if it's dict then you can access them by keys,0
Yup,0
ey quick question,0
"```class Animal: def __init__(self,id): self.id = id self.size = random.randint(0,10) self.strength= self.size+random.randint(0,5) self.power= self.strength/20  def __repr__(self): return f {self.id}"" #  {self.size} {self.strenght}""animals = dict()for i in range(3): animal = Animal(i) animals[i]=[animal.size animal.strength animal.power]def fight(animal1 animal2)```",1
how do i check if a specific item is in a list,0
so it's a dict now,0
@Deleted User you know that you can store animal directly?,0
@Deleted User ```py'dog in list> False```,0
@Deleted User do i use that in a if?,0
you don't have to unpack animal properties to list,0
Yes,0
So just `if dog in list:`,0
wym sorry,0
Yup,0
Alright thanks brother.,0
👍,0
animals[i] = Animal(i),0
oh ok you talking to senz,0
Yeah lol,0
"```class Animal: def __init__(self,id): self.id = id self.size = random.randint(0,10) self.strength= self.size+random.randint(0,5) self.power= self.strength/20  def __repr__(self): return f {self.id}"" #  {self.size} {self.strenght}""animals = dict()for i in range(3): animal = Animal(i) animals[i]=[animal.size animal.strength animal.power]def fight(animal1 animal2)```",1
so I have a dict now but I'd like to refer to specific animal of this dictin the last function,0
how do I do that ?,0
https://tenor.com/view/loudhouseloudhouseseriesloudhousegifsfamilyhugsiblingsgif16585157,0
Because it's an easy and simple solution that works.,0
"@Deleted User Try to run this code ```pyimport randomclass Animal: def __init__(self id): self.id = id self.size = random.randint(0,10) self.strength = self.size + random.randint(0,5) self.power = self.strength/20 def __repr__(self): return f""Animal(id={self.id} size={self.size} strength={self.strength})""animals = dict()for i in range(3): animals[i] = Animal(i)print(animals)```",1
You could change stuff to see how it works or i can explain it,0
> that worksarguable,0
For the most part,0
you just changed the loop ?,0
i also changed repr a bit,0
If you do it correctly it'll work lol,0
Yes,0
Pyinstaller does a great job at that y'know,0
It won\'t be compiling technically,0
Well of course,0
It's packing if you want to get technical,0
It will just bundle interpreter src and all the deps into exe,0
the loop doesnt work anymore,0
wdym 🙂,0
it says animal not defined if I add the [i],0
add it where?,0

man it's already ```pyfor i in range(3): animals[i] = Animal(i)```,0
can i make desktop app with python,0
Yes,0

nah,0

okay,0

come in help zinc @Doctor plz someone helping me too if you will,0

i am studiying python from his you tube channel,0

I already know python it's been a while since i coded in it,0

hey guys Ive created a class and I want to generate creation of this class objects in a loop. But how to give them different name as they are generated I created an ID attribute and do as follows but it seems all my objects will be called ```animal``` how is this possible ? I want to be able to access those objects in the future and change their attributes.```animals = dict()animalslist = []for i in range(3): animal = Animal(i) animals[i]=[animal.size animal.strength animal.power] animalslist.append(animal)```,1
dont worry about the dict and the list the important part is animal= Animal(i),0
how do I do animali=Animal(i) where animal takes the name animali,0
@Deleted User So you want to assign `animal1` to be `Animal(1)` and so on?,0
yeah so each animals take the name animal+its ID i,0
and they arent all called animal,0
guys can anyone help,0
its not related to python,0
@Deleted User Why? You can just assign `Animal(i)` to `animals[i]` and access it like `animals[1]` and `animals[2]````py animals[i] = Animal(i)```,0
Is there something with which I can check if the math solution is correct,0
math solution?,0
@fix error yeah in this case it would take them from my list or my dictionary the problem is I'd like to refer to the actual object and change some of its self.attribute in the future so I dont think using the list key would work ? wdy think ?,1
I want to manipulate those objects,0
like if a i do ````x^2  10 = 15``and ```,0
and `x = 5`,0
then it should give correct and if not then wrong,0
if animals would be called animal1 it would be way easier,0
but I should be able to make this for most factorization problems is there a way that I can do that?,1
I'd do change animal1.attribute,0
"@Deleted User Nothing stops you from manipulating objects that are stored in a dict.```pyclass Animal: def __init__(self name age): self.name = name self.age = age animals = {""joe"": Animal(""joe 42) dave"": Animal(""dave 128)}animals[""joe""].name = bob""```",1
so I can refer to the animal like animal[0] and it actually select the object ?,0
like changing its attribute by referring to it,0
Yes.,0
hmm okay I will try it thanks,0
if u can help me then pls happen to ping me,0

> i still dont understand howPython Help: Available works@Deleted User you have a question you click one of the two channels there send something the channel is now yours,1
you're missing a `()` @<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël],0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] write more cleaner,0
how do i ask the operation to be done and do that to the two inputted numbers? i mean i wanna make a calculator,1
css,0
then js,0
or both maybe,0
they're quite different,0
feel like you should be learning them concurrently TBH,0
> You should learn one programming language at a time@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] CSS isn't even a programming language.,0
> That is not a good approach to programming@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] can you justify that statement?,0
css is just clothes for html lol,0
for starters I think you should defo learn HTML and CSS together,0
they serve a fairly different purpose from JS,0
and if you want to learn how webpages work you should at least have a baseline understanding of all the parts,1
which means HTML CSS and JS as well as basic theory like the request/response cycle,0
it's not like learning say Java and Kotlin together where you could very easily get confused,0
sorry for spamming but my question got pushed away. how do i perform the inputted operation to two inputted numbers?,0
> sorry for spamming but my question got pushed away. how do i perform the inputted operation to two inputted numbers?@Deleted User what do you mean?,1
how do i ask the operation to be done and do that to the two inputted numbers? i mean i wanna make a calculator,1
idk,0
> how do i ask the operation to be done and do that to the two inputted numbers? i mean i wanna make a calculator@Deleted User you can use `input()` along with an `ifelifelse` statements,1
> I think it's Python.h@Bast I think they're asking for a Python library which serves the same purpose,0
@gm i know but how do i use the operation on the inputted numbers if the operation is also inputted?,0
literally what I said.,0
how?,0
Yo anyone worked with selenium?,0
ohhhhhh now i get it!!,0
thank you!,0
```py>>> a = 1>>> b = 2>>> def calc(a b):... operand = input()... if operand == +':... return a + b... elif operand == ':... return a  b... ... # more here...>>> calc(1 2)+3```,1

smh.,0
> smh.@Arceus just ask your question instead of gatekeeping who can answer it,0
but how do i get it to do the same thing with two different inputs?,0
you can also try #datascienceandai #unittesting #webdevelopment and/or #❔｜howtogethelp depending on the nature of your question.,0
> but how do i get it to do the same thing with two different inputs?@Deleted User what do you mean?,1
just store input in `a` and `b` above,0
it's the same concept,0
like `addition` and `+` would do the same thing,0
ah,0
there are a few ways to do that,0
you can have multiple conditions e.g. `if operand == + or operand == add or operand == addition':`,0
hmmm which one for a noob like me?,0
or you can use a `set`: `if operand in {'+ add addition'}`,0
do you understand how both work?,0
like a list?,0
well like a `list` except it's a `set`,0
notice that `{}` are used instead of `[]`,0
ohhh ok,0
yes i noticed that,0
so the difference is that checking if something is in a `set` takes the same amount of time regardless of how big a `set` is whereas for a `list` it scales with size.,1
for this case it doesn't matter but IMO it's a good habit to have,0
whenever all you want to do with a collection is check if stuff is in it prefer `set` to `list`,0
oh ok thanks!!,0
also @Raghava put ` in the start and the end of the code not,0

@weefl0 it's a string that can use variables in your program to render results based on what they're set to.,0

@weefl0 with that example you can place `name` into another string freely so you can do things that aren't possible with just `print` alone or are only possible in a very convoluted way.,1

@appling what does in do in the code you sent as an example?,0
hi guys if i wanted to use regex to look for the numbers 98 and 74 in a string would it be possible to do it in one search?,1
What is GIL ?,0
No,0
ohh so its saying equal to @appling ?,0
ok.,0
so you made m a variable for simplicity?,0
so you owuldnt have to type male?,0
mk.,0
i once used a format string for that @$oRonny and somebody exploited it,0
me too man @Dasketch,0
they're the best,0
nowdays people use .format() instead,0
that's the most basic form of sql injection,0
if the user won't touch the database at all fstrings are fine,0
you can do basic checks inside of f strings,0
in sql u shouldn't use fstrings but in general they're awesome,0
@Dasketch wdym by controling the input?,0
like going through every input that is sent by a user before making a query?,0
@appling can you tell me if this is right? (i will be rightin some code with the stuff i learned here),1
new to python anyone can make this login system better?,0
```user = input(“user: “)password = input(“password: “)if (user) == (“xoh”): print(“ “)else: print(“wrong username”)if (password) == (“xoh2512”): print(“logged in“)else: print(“wrong password”)```,1

parentheses aren’t needed where?,0
but in the if statements just do user == xoh2512 instead of (user) == (“xoh”),0
oh ok ty,0

"when u say in my function do you mean after if phone_number.lower()""?",0
`python m pip`,0
does `python version` work?,0
how are you running your python files then?,0
ok,0
you need to add both to the PATH,0
first find which directory python is installed in,0
@MatSixFive It's a option when you install it,0
You should be able to do it with the installer,0
@Lay you can also do it manually,0
@hmmm True but it is the easiest to explain,0
Are we actually running program on different threads when we use threading in python?,0
WEEEWOOOOWEEEEEWOOOO,0
@appling i am really confused on how to define these functions any other tips?,0
its not printing anything when i od the thing @appling,0
"```pythonMale = Truedef is_male_true(name age gender): if gender in [\'male\']: print(f""you name is {name} and you are {age} and your phone number is {gender}"")is_male_true(""boyname 35 gender"")```",1
> threads are for i/o bounded tasks@pathcl This is not the case. You're thinking of coroutines/async.,0
In most languages threads are perfectly fine for CPUbound tasks.,0
i wanna test it @appling,0
i am trying to teach myself and stuff,0
ok,0
@pathcl I quoted you.,0
Threads aren't particularly good for I/Obound tasks and threads are perfectly fine for CPUbound tasks in general. You want coroutines/async for I/Obound tasks.,1
@appling ok. so many things have gone into my head already 😕 im just mildly overwhelmed.. its like things are going in my head and right back out again? is there any way i can stop this frm happening?,1
@Deleted User Take a break.,0
Your brain absorbs information even when you're not actively learning.,0
> @Deleted User Take a break.@dementati okay. thanks for the helpful tip.,0
im gonna go get a snack. this server is amazing by the way 🙂,0
@Deleted User Good idea. And thank you.,0
Caught by the filter.,0
I was reading about the GIL and it said that there is no actual multithreading in python.. it runs on a single thread,1
@pathcl Ok sorry I misinterpreted you. Python threads are probably only suitable for I/Obound tasks. Threading in general (OS threading and threading in most languages) is good for CPUbound tasks. async/await provides more useful abstractions for dealing with I/Obound parallelism though.,1

Why isn't there a django channel?,0
I mean it's a main lib in PY,0
@BalmierLight There is #webdevelopment,0
Yeah but that is general,0
@BalmierLight The channels we have right now are motivated mainly by traffic.,0
i see,0
If we had enough people asking about Django we'd probably have a Django channel.,0
> @BalmierLight the topical channels are meant for use cases of python not specific python libraries@Spacecraft1013 cough cough || #discordbots || cough cough,1
If you'd like to discuss the server in detail please do so in #communitymeta.,0
This channel is for discussion of Python itself.,0
@gcoder You can discuss that in #communitymeta,0
Because that's the purpose of that channel.,0

Can anyone ELI5 multiprocessing vs multithreading?,0
> anyone here knows how to make an exploit@Cipher Not allowed on this server,0
Who does cyber security?,0
hello,0
@Numerlor so even if I use multithreading the GIL won't actually make my code faster?,0
@Phaedra Leonidas Yes.,0
Unless it's say a TKinter app where each button uses another thread,0
I like Kali Linux; Code In C# C++ And Python,0
I create Botnets for Mining and DDoS Attacks,0

Ok,0
Has anyone created ransomware I’m able to test?,0
I’ve tested most malware on a VM,0
> > There are some edge cases where there is some postprocessing done outside of the python process where it would give you some performance but in general yes it won't get you any speed (and will actually take from it because context switches now have to occur)> @Numerlor Interesting. I saw a conference from a big shot (I think) in the python world where he tried to remove the GIL and ended up slowing down the code which makes me wonder why it's even there in the first place,1
Who’s heard Of WannaCry,0
@Deleted User We don't help with or allow discussion of projects that can be used for malicious purposes such as malware.,1
incoming ban,0
Why?,0
@Deleted User If you'd like to discuss the rules please do so in #communitymeta.,0
This is a channel for discussion of the Python language.,0
hello,0
So im not allowed to ask about any malware I would happy test like wannacry because to try to stop the encryption,1

(only talking about possiblities not good or bad),0
Also there are people like black hats within the cyber security community and some are grey and want to help stop encryption with the ransom wares given out even though there mother servers are down.,1
yeah,0
but its not ez,0
> @Zavion doubt it@tower of free robux youtube was made with python ( random fact),0

@Deleted User I don't see how this is Pythonrelated.,0
For PayPals you can probably dictionary brute force,0

backend is connection between things,0
and all that stuff,0
cool,0
flask is the most easiest backend framework from popularity,0
i started learning python recently,0
framework is like pre built funtions classes etc u can use,0
im learning while rn,0
while loops?,0
yeah,0
kk,0
its kinda hard,0
get dont with basics of programming,0
> get dont with basics of programming@Deleted User what,0
while loop just keeps running/iterating over code,0
i know that,0
till a specefic condition is met,0
just dont know when to use it,0
ez,0
or how,0
youll know you just need to make alot of projects,0
you will slowly understand,0
google things when you get an error,0
oh yeah,0
stack overflow is the easiest way to get your code working again,0
lol,0
laz,0
yeah,0
but sometimes there r things like,0
why isnt \\ working,0
how do i put scripts in that one font,0
well you need to use raw string or double\\,0
@Mick To most effectively make use of unit testing you need to change how you write your code.,0
and errors you get,0
stack overflow makes it easy to debug (ofcourse we try it ourselves before),0
is there a chanel to show my code,0
or do i just put it here,0
@Mick You can do this by breaking out code that interacts with external components like databases into thin simple abstractions.,0
why you wana change it to 0001,0
@Zavion idk,0
@Mick And keep that code separate from the meat of your application logic.,0
i spent my precious creative hours trying to install pygame last night....fail. too many dependencies. 💩 Kivy seems very intuitive and easy to install. going that route unless there is something easier and more intuitive?,1
ppl commonly post code here,0
@heyletswinwin i just did pip install pygame,0
which os u on?,0
"guys look pasirinkimas = int(input(""Iveskite skaiciu nuo 0 iki 20: ))while (pasirinkimas < 0 or pasirinkimas > 20): pasirinkimas = int(input (""Dar karta iveskite skaiciu nuo 0 iki 20: ))veiksmas = input(""Pasirinkite veiksmą: (+): )pasirinkimas2 = int(input(""Iveskite skaiciu nuo 0 iki 20: ))while (pasirinkimas2 < 0 or pasirinkimas2 > 20): pasirinkimas2 = int(input (""Dar karta iveskite skaiciu nuo 0 iki 20: ))if veiksmas == \'+\': print(int(pasirinkimas2) + int(pasirinkimas2))",1
@Mick You can mock out the module that talks to the database in your unit tests.,0
or r u using virutal env?,0
its in my native languege,0
so you prob wont understand it,0
@Zavion btw it wont matter if you dont use the brackets with while loop,0
> @Zavion btw it wont matter if you dont use the brackets with while loop@Deleted User () these ?,0
yeah,0
@Mick Yeah you can replace certain real components with a mock object which has the same interface as the real component which you can configure to respond in a predefined way when called.,1
@Mick https://www.toptal.com/python/anintroductiontomockinginpython,0
i do it like this ```while a < b:  print('hi')```,0
no braces needed,0
unless your doing complex maths,0
@Deleted User so did I....i spent 2h googling shit...py3.6 its 💩 kivy has a pretty website and seems developed by non dinosaurs,1
> i do it like this ```while a < b: > print('hi')```@Deleted User oh cool,0
@Mick That's probably because your code is not designed well.,0
@heyletswinwin i have python 3.8,0
k nice,0
i like it that way,0
You need to write testable code in order to be able to write good unit tests. And testable code incidentally is also readable and maintainable.,1
@Mick Yeah that's bad design.,0
@TestyExorcist wdym,0
?,0
im asking what do you mean,0
is python almost = c++?,0
@Mick This is kind of a complex topic and I can't really explain it very well without giving examples and unfortunately I don't have time to do that right now.,1
uh,0
what,0
Sorry for the anticlimactic answer.,0
why in my learning program it says python comparison to c++,0
or somethign,0
@Mick I mean you can test a function with 4 parameters you just define the inputs call the function and compare the result with the expected output.,1
@P. Refrain from posting offtopic images in ontopic channels or discussing offtopic subjects in general.,0

can someone help me with this code pls,0
should i use pycharm instead of visual studio code?,0
omg the owner is typing in chat'?!!,0
well yeah but you can make a circular linked list by pointing the `next` of the last node to the head,1
anyone i am trying to make a bot so it will warn and delete message after 3 warns a person gets all roles taken away then the mute role is added.,1
actually no because the slowmode but he'll get muted by a mod,0
if you know anything dm me,0
that's not minimodding he's just advising you on what not to do,0

@guy_frm_yogaland Circumventing captcha is pretty much a guaranteed ToS violation and as such we cannot help you with this on this server.,1
!rule 5,0
,0
@guy_frm_yogaland Seems like you were warned about this two days ago.,0
Do not ask about something like this again next time there will be consequences.,0
Well in any case you would do well to go over the rules again.,0
Especially rule 5.,0
Hacking offensive cybersecurity spam etc. If you're going to be doing website automation or scraping it's your responsibility to read up on the terms of service for that website and prove that you are not in violation.,1
If you're not sure you can DM @Python Discord ModMail and ask.,0
c++ is better fuck python,0
jk,0
@guy_frm_yogaland Automated testing of your own website is not a ToS violation.,0
It's when someone not affiliated with the owner of the website is doing it that it tends to be against the ToS.,1
I have a problem when trying to understand libraries I try to learn a new library let's say to capture keyboard events but I don't understand the docs what can I do? Any tips?,1
hey bros i want to write something that takes a number from a files eg `x = 123` and manipulate that number eg `123  2` then replace the old number with the new number and save the file. Anyone knwow where i should start or if theres a youtube tutorial?,1
am too stupid to be here lmfao,0
@dsnk If you own the website you are the one setting the ToS so you can't violate it.,0
@guy_frm_yogaland If you get explicit permission from the owner to perform a test then it's not in violation.,0
@dsnk Not necessarily. It might just be verifying the functionality of the frontend.,0
To look for bugs in the UI.,0
Or to do endtoend testing.,0
@dsnk Pentesting without permission is not just against the ToS it's a felony.,0
You are required to read and accept the rules when you join the server.,0
Ignorance is not a defense.,0
Not discussing or facilitating breaking ToS or laws is a Discordwide rule.,0
eh its a little of a grey area cause some companies allow bug bounties,0
which is basically an invitation to pentest,0
If you wish to continue discussing the rules of this server please move to #communitymeta or any of the offtopic channels.,1
This is a channel for Python discussion.,0
and that would be breaking TOS,0
because its not thru their api lol,0
> does anyone know much about dictionaries@Ray What would you like to know?,0
twitter also has limitations and rules for their API usage as well like you cant interact with users without their consent for example,1
for scraping theres literally a search feature u can just use in the api lol,0
really? can i get a source?i like to just imply its not allowed if im not sure. but web scraping when you have API access that can do that is pointless,1
Can someone help me with a login system?,0
please do yourself a favor and do not for the love of god install python thru microsoft store,0
@Danisher are you familiar with using the `pip` tool to install third party Python modules?,0
@Deleted User @dsnk @escaleta This is deviating a bit from the topic of this channel. Could you please continue this in offtopic?,1
now install the modules you need with pip,0
`pip install moduleName`,0
Why not through microsoft?,0
microsoft store is shit and limits what you can do with appsid assume the same for python on it,0
Good to know,0
it is not comparable at all to simply running an exe and files,0
@Danisher if creating a Discord bot is your first Python project I'm going to suggest you learn some more about how it works including its tooling before attempting this because otherwise you're going to be very frustrated,1
Were do people learn python besides books,0
i remember my first time with discord.py. didnt understand anything lmao,0
@Deleted User videos online tutorial sites personal projects,0
cause i didnt know python,0
Hey @Danisher!,0
Any good beginner projects,0
Recommendations,0
!projects,0
,0
I guess bot knows best,0
@Danisher it helps if you provide us with information about the error. We can't read your screen,0
Any good security python project recommendations,0
I'm trying to get into cyber security,0
dont do security yourselfalso python is not a secure language,0
No I mean,0
Coding a beginner security program,0
security program is too vague to address as a project idea.,0
!paste,0
,0
use one of those to paste the whole error.,0
i mean what i said? it isn't,0
Was wondering the same thing,0
java is more secure,0
that makes three of us. Please elucidate,0
secure in what sense? that\'s a vacuous term,0
@Danisher did you install Python 3.9?,0
why are you out to attack me? lol,0
hold up.,0
you don't need to install the VSC++ tools,0
Does anybody use annaconda?,0
you just need to use an earlier version of Python that will support all this stuff without having to compile it from scratch.,1
i love python but it\'s not as secure when compared to java and other languages based on how easily you can reverse engineer code on it public/private access etc. its not a hardened language . but it\'s security really depends on what you\'re doing with it,1
at least I've been told im no security expert,0
If you are trying to download python try anaconda,0
Its got a bunch of stuff,0
you don't need anaconda that will just complicate things,0
Y,0
you use anaconda for projects that require a lot of modules and when you want separate environments,0
and most modern IDEs can also make their own environments,0
yeah Anaconda is often more topheavy than is needed for most people,0
What do u mean,0
https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/19959/ispythonasecureprogramminglanguageforcryptography,0
@Danisher you don't need to install any of that. From your error I saw you seem to be running Python 3.9. Is that correct?,1
that's a thread on cryptography but it also extends into the points i was making,0
Ok,0
Well what i meant to say is,0
Can you code a security program on python?,0
@Deleted User a security program could be anything. can you be more specific?,0
Give me ideas,0
@Deleted User what kind of security program?,0
Like a basic virus scanner or,0
@Danisher okay. The problem is Python 3.9 does not yet have support from many thirdparty modules. So you need to0. uninstall Python 3.9,1
like an antivirus? i suggest not but you could check hashes to check if the file is a known virus or something i guess lol,1
1. Get the 64bit Python installer: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.6/python3.8.6amd64.exe2. Run the installer and be sure to check add Python to PATH during the install process.,1
most of the time you don't need 64bit python and it causes issues,0
3. reinstall `discord` using `pip install discord`,0
Yeah I tried pip,0
You can typically remove it from the Apps section of Windows Settings,0
iirc python won't even utilize all 64 bits,0
It was to complicated,0
@Deleted User that's not accurate.,0
most of the time,0
Bro if u struggling try,0
Annaconda,0
@Deleted User many third party packages do not have precompiled 32bit binaries and will not work properly so at this point it makes more sense to use 64bit builds of Python,1
Yes 64 bits its the way to go,0
If you want to hide the source code of a python program you could compile it with Nutika.,0
One comprehensive beginner book for 2020?,0
I'd remove them all actually and add the one I linked to,0
32 bit just tends to produce less trouble: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3117626/shouldiusepython32bitorpython64bit,0
python also defaults to x86 as an installation option on the website they recommend it,0
@Deleted User that question is ten years old.,0
and?,0
things have kind of moved on since then.,0
Hey guys I’m having trouble doing my project could any one help?,0
not really?,0
Hey guys I’m having trouble doing my project could any one help?,0
that and it's been both my experience and the experience of plenty of other people here that the 64bit builds are far less troublesome,1
we have people who constantly ask for help with third party packages not installing correctly and one of the biggest culprits is they're running 32bit Python and need a package that no longer provides 32bit binary wheels.,1
huh i suppose im wrong. my bad,0

does sublime text has intellisense?,0
🤔,0
sublime is wayy overrated tbh lol,0
@Danisher next is up to you! if you want detailed help with the discord.py module we have a channel for it #discordbots,1
what is lighter sublime or vsc,0
cause i have a crappy laptop,0
@ali! this is a help topic #❔｜howtogethelp but print() does not return anything so you cannot use it when comparing,0
and you cant set a var to it,0
strictly speaking `print` returns `None`,0
what is lighter sublime or vsc,0

@M7mD ツ this is it!,0
if you want detailed help #❔｜howtogethelp,0
PyInstaller?,0
https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/IfThingsGoWrong check the first section here seem slike you might need to specify `requests` in the `hiddenimport` section of the `.spec` file,1
@Daison oh that's a tricky one. you MIGHT get more of a targeted answer in #datascienceandai as some LaTeXfamiliar folks might be in there,1
@M7mD ツ read in the docs about the use of the `.spec` file. A lot of common problems in PyInstaller stem from needing to specify hidden imports,1
PyInstaller really isn't a pushabuttonandgo solution it only looks like one,0
no. Please read the documentation,0
okay here's the deal:,0
when you first run PyInstaller on a project it generates a `.spec` file that's in your projects root directory. With that you can customize future runs of PyInstaller to do things like include imports that it doesn't detect properly (in this case `requests`),1
https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/specfiles.html,0
that doc goes into how spec files can be generated reused edited etc. They're the key to making PyInstaller work right,1
please don't post video links in here this isn't the channel for it,0
you thought a video of your code would be better than just pasting it,0
I understand it I just hate working with it :D,0
Hi guys I started my programming class recently,0
I have a issue,0
I wrote my program but it says no module find stdio,0
@کیهان post your code?,0
@Infinimata It's an homework so I don't think I should do it here,0
@M7mD ツ no you rerun PyInstaller and feed it the `.spec` file as an argument. read the docs!,0
@M7mD ツ yes like I said the first time :D,0
@CumSock the book Fluent Python is a great resource in this regard,0
@M7mD ツ another word of advice  don't use `onefile` when you're first putting the app together. Using that should be your last step once you verify everything works. `onefile` can slow down the launch time of your app and create a lot of temporary files,1
,0
based on reading the source you call it?,0
https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/blob/master/com/win32com/client/dynamic.py,0
```python def __str__(self): # __str__ is used when the user does print object so we gracefully # fall back to the __repr__ if the object has no default method. try: return str(self.__call__()) except pythoncom.com_error as details: if details.hresult not in ERRORS_BAD_CONTEXT: raise return self.__repr__()```,1
so im guessing `self.simulation.DataTables('ProcData2').data()` should work,0
@Mrpolymath,0
that doesn't look like the repl,0
are you trying to emulate the repl in a file?,0
dont copypaste the repl code into a file,0
since thats going to also copy the prompt and the output,0

@Wealth That's generally how it works,0
I'm assuming you're looking to sell equity?,0
Venture capital firms are literally shark tank but without the reality TV stunts,0
The premise is the same,0
Although usually there are like 2050 investors rather than 5 and the quiz you a lot more,0
No but I am a Qt,0
requests is great anyway,0
@Howl what you doing,0
bro we aren't front end,0
Yeah,0
That is what it is,0
If you're looping over a range the value will continuously reset with the newest value,0
"So if:```for i in range(0 20): input = input(""Enter value: )```",0
You will put in 20 values but end up with one input,0
If you wanted to keep all 20 you would want to save into a list and use the append method,0
You wouldn't use input if you're getting values from a webpage,0
What's wrong with it,0
while 1:,0
What?,0
What is the while value?,0
Oh fair enough,0
@Supermania Because you're putting it into a string,0
You need to loop through each value and join if you wanna get rid of the format,0
well...,0
"```pythondef user_info(name age gender): if gender.lower() in [\'male\']: print(f""you are a {gender} and you are {age} years old.

anyway i can do that?,0
< 12,0
thank u,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan wherwe would i put that into my code?,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan where wou;ldi put < 12 in my code?,0
check if the number is less than 12,0
it's not my code ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan im asking where would i put < 12 in my code,0
in an if statement,0
k,0
`if gender.lower() in ['male']:` not sure why you're doing this when the list has one element?,0
also both those print statements can execute in the same call which is probably not what you want,0
"so like this:```pythonif age == < 12: print(""ajdawid"")```??",0
if it's related to python,0
he's right though,0
no you couldn't really,0
it'd be off topic 🤔,0
"@✪ SavagePastaMan likke this?:so like this:```pythonif age == < 12: print(""ajdawid"")```??",0
no like how 4 other people said,0
hi,0
@IgnisDa,0
@Draco no...,0

> Does anyone know how I can scrape data off of this site?@Jeremiah yes,0
You need to log in,0
Yeah requests gives back html,0
Create a login api using Selenium (easy) or scrapy (hard),0
@Draco the point is that if it's a math question that is related to python and a program that you are actually writing then it belongs here. we have 3 off topic chats if it doesn't fit those criteria that you can ask your question in,1
@The_Man21 Try making a pygame thats like the offline dino run game in chrome,0
@Deleted User Why selenium,0
If the website returns static pages or the data exists on the page already just use xpath,0
> @Deleted User Why selenium@Snailbass Scrapy dies a bit on more advanced encryption websites,0
Sounds fun,0
Dino game,0
Selenium mimicks an actual person so it often gets around bot trackers,0
Login with selenium then scrape with scrapy,0
And isn't puppeteer a more popular choice,0
What's puppeteer,0
Chrome but with automation features,0
Not in my experience of scraping,0
> Login with selenium then scrape with scrapyMost websites I've seen let you login via an API and a csrf token,1
@The_Man21 Dang i just got into python like 6 months ago,0
> Most websites I've seen let you login via an API and a csrf token@Snailbass Yeah but many don't,0
Like Facebook for example,0
> If they're tracking bots they probably already have something in the ToS to prevent scraping no?@Zilcher Yes but who cares about ToS if you're scraping,1
um,0
It isn't legally binding,0
@The_Man21 Do you think i can get the files and play it??,0
,0
Oh really? My bad,0
I thought it was just illegal activity,0
uh yeah that kind of stuff matters lol,0
Pretty hard to scrape effectively without breaking ToS in my experience though,0
What is scraping,0
?,0
ToS's aren't legally binding,0
All they can really do is ban you from the website,0
They aren't because there's no legal enforcement,0
It's their own rules,0
Especially for public information which is generally what scrapers go for,0
There have been cases where people got sued and lost for scraping websites,0
They can only go after you legally if you break copyright which in the case of websites which host public information don't break,1
Or if you use the scraped data for illegal purposes,0
it was for the wayback archive as well,0
Pure scraping and breaking ToS isn't illegal it's only illegal if you break an actual law by breaking the ToS,0
So scraped data is like old data no one uses?,0
It's just that the page had a line that said `by scraping this page you agree to pay $500 beforehand or $5000 per page if you fail to pay before scraping` or something along that lines,1
> So scraped data is like old data no one uses?@Deleted User It's just data in general,0
> It's just that the page had a line that said `by scraping this page you agree to pay $500 beforehand or $5000 per page if you fail to pay before scraping` or something along that lines@Snailbass Sure but it's legally unenforcable,1
They got sued,0
And they lost,0
It\'s like putting every time you go back a page you have to pay £500 isn\'t legally enforcable,0
Maybe they had bad lawyers,0
And I'm not in the US so it would never work here,0
The wayback archive had bad lawyers?,0
I mean contracts are thrown out all the time because of stuff like this,0
Scraping is a grey area Enoch don't talk about it with such confidence. Different cases had different outcomes,0
If you don\'t pay rent on time you owe us $2000 for example,0
It's virtually unenforcable in the courts,0
Go ahead ramble all you want... I'd recommend that you read up on the topic after though,0
So can any website be scraped . Sorry noob here.,0
Scraping by itself isn't illegal how you use the data could be,0
Virtually all scraping cases are down to copyright issues,0
I love how you're dropping a lot of bullshit when it's a casebycase question,0
Scraping and selling private info ike phone numbers,0
That's perfectly sueable,0
Yeah,0
Which is what every case I have seen has been,0

You know what never mind,0
Copyright is where the issue is. People are sued because an individual may sign a contract with a company like Facebook agreeing to provide private data and an individual scraping that data with no previous contract is legally stealing that data,1

Hi @Neem,0
thx,0
but i have one major problem @noboat,0
i am getting this,0
,0
no matter how simple of code when i try to import discord it says no file found,0
or code 2,0
how do i properly download discord,0
ok so,0
when i type in my code and run it through PyCharm,0
it says error,0
hi,0
ok,0
,0
look where it says import discord,0
i regenerated it,0
before i posted thats,0
so that was a dead token,0
i will post it again,0
,0
what is it?,0
its 3.9,0
but it cant find a discord file,0
how do i install Discord,0
ok,0
i am on mac,0
i dont know if i did or did noit,0
not,0
how do i check,0
ok,0
how do i run pip,0
@noboat,0
ok,0
ok,0
what do i do once the commands pop up,0
ok,0
now what do i do,0
i did,0
it worked,0
but let me try the code,0
yo,0
i have a method called random for my discord bot (THIS IS NOT A DISCORDPY QUESTION) it conflicts with the random module namewhat should i name the method?,1
@Mrpolymath post code and full traceback,0
dont call it random?,0
or do `import random as something_else`,0
@Deleted User,0
thats okay to do?,0
what does that even have to do with doubles,0
still showing up that error,0
what lib,0
,0
what library,0
@Mrpolymath,0
so im allowed to call the method `_random` by convention,0
can you post more of your code,0
currently i have no idea what `act_doc` is,0
,0
eew what the fuck is BSTR,0
sounds like something you would find in win32 api,0
can you link me the docs,0
google has failed me,0
oh,0
Hey @Mrpolymath!,0
im guessing that you need to find a method that sets `CurrentTimeValue`,0
Hey @Mrpolymath!,0
hi,0
"What does it mean if you see code defining a variable as _foo""?",0
Ah I read in google it's to signify it's private ur answer makes more sense,0
o,0
ok so things only used inside the method,0
Ah thank you for resolving that confusion of mine,0
They seemed quite spontaneous doe,0
#discordbots,0
da hell is this: requests.utils.unquote,0
pycharm says utils has no unquote so um yup,0
> #discordbots,0
"Not sure at all although what classifies as details""?",0
Ah,0
@Pippe start with some basic tutorials in youtube,0
So like calling init again with updated inputs but without creating a new class?,0
I might very well by lacking intellect but perhaps you could create a update function which is basically a copy of init but now you can call it anytime you want,1
and just call update() in init,0
depending on the IDE it might yell at u for not defining the self.foo variables in the init cause they're in the update() function now so you could just set all the variables to None before calling update,1
@Sirc __init__ runs only when you create a class for the first time,0
do u know what a class is,0
u might want to figure out classes first,0
perhaps,0
a solid maybe,0
Name it anything that works I don't know any resources for that either but ill show u what I mean gimme a minute,1
@DB ```pythonclass server: def __init__(self kwargs): self.update(kwargs)  def update(self address port packetsize conexpected): s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET socket.SOCK_STREAM) self.address = address self.port = port self.packetsize = packetsize self.conexpected = conexpected```,1
Might be args tho Honestly still not exactly sure whats the difference,0
@Deleted User 😢,0
@DB but now u can call update() whenever u need. or whatever u call it,0
^,0
its fun if anything,0
Async takes a little to get used to,0
I can vouch for pycharm,0
Pycharm takes care of virtually everything properly and just lets u code,0
@Deleted User i love you...,0
once you download pycharm it's nice,0
why you dont love me,0
🤔,0
but let's not start an ide war,0
python interface = notepad,0
but in ur question it replaces python,0
what does `isinstance` do?,0
idk lets google it,0
ah: The Python isinstance() function is used to check whether the object or variable is an instance of the specified class type or data type. For example you have a variable number = 90  and you want to check the number is an instance of an int type,1
ohh do we have to insert the class as well when we check for it?,0
so we do,0
~~an_instance.~~isinstance(the_class),0
ok,0
!d isinstance,0
thx,0
,0
wait am i wrong,0
> an_instance.isinstance(the_class)that’s not how it works,0
@Inheritance ♦ come back i messed up,0
wait i am trying it myself,0
!e```pyprint(isinstance(40 int))```,0
@dennis :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```True```,0
ye i got it,0
thx,0
yup that makes more sense then isinstance being a method from the object class like what I wrote implied,0
```py>>> hello = list>>> isinstance(hello list)False>>>>>> hello = list()>>> isinstance(hello list)True```how come the first one returned false?,0
because the first is a class,0
not an instance of a class,0
ohhh,0
You are not allowed to use that command here. Please use the #botcommands channel instead.,0
Since there isn't an officially supported case/switch in python is there any recommended way to have neater code than 20 elifs? Or is it recommended to stick to 20 elifs?,1
@carrot you may want to check out this guild since not too many people are experienced with that here https://discord.gg/CbVJYtz,0
@Deleted User use a dictionary to map conditions to functions is one common way to do it,0
another is to use a class's methods and use dynamic lookup on their names,0
Is that necessarily faster? Case/Switch is used to improve speed along with looks.,0
@Deleted User dictionary lookups are constant time.,0
Note that lambdas can be replaced with full blown function references for more complex operations but that's the basic idea,0
Sure but I mean in comparison to simply having elif statements. Would a dictionary form of case/switch be faster than a bunch of elif statements?,1
again dict lookup is constant time,0
so it won't matter how many items are in the dict it'll still be performant,0
If you only have say 56 items in an if/elif chain it's not so bad but anything beyond that and you want a more elegant solution if only for the sake of making the code less bletcherous to read,1
I’m not asking about the consistency of dictionary parsing. I’m asking if I were to have the same code twice once with a bunch of elifs and second with a dictionary case/switch then I started a timer and ran both at the same time would the dictionary version finish in shorter time?,1
what does this mean,0
the dictionary version would never be slower than a certain amount. As far as the exact timing 1) there's no way to really know without running that benchmark yourself and 2) for this kind of thing the difference in performance is going to be so marginal to begin with that it's scarcely worth worrying about unless you're doing these operations hundreds of thouands of times in a tight loop.,1
where else wuld i ask this question,0
Okie dokie. Good enough for me. Thanks.,0
@FaresFilms the folks in #datascienceandai might be able to give more detailed guidance,0
wasn't there a magic method for getting the attributes of a class?,0
what was it?,0
u never finish python,0
if you could answer my question the pls happen to ping me,0
@Deleted User indexing doesn't mean it's currently searching. From what I know indexing is sorting data by attributes so each has it's own index in order. Which then helps binary searching,1
@Cypheriel I understand u,0
i got it thx,0
no,0

can you ratelimit in tkinter if so how?,0
@Pie'.'Thon bruh check my last message,0
!e,0
You are not allowed to use that command here. Please use the #botcommands channel instead.,0
You need to add [1:7:1],0
to go backwards,0
@Pie'.'Thon btw I just tested it [1:0:1] works too,0
Maybe even better since you don't need to know the length of the string,0
1 = start 0 = end 1 =step,0
0 is the first character,0
As is 7,0
But no counting needed,0
It checks whether the list is empty,0
there is no ! in python right ?,0
there is,0
if 1 != 2:,0
boolean not,0
like a negative in math,0
no,0
That's,0
(1) = 1,0
not false = true,0
0 != 1,0
false is 0,0
so are empty strings,0
but in your case,0
empty lists are falsy,0
same with empty strings and 0,0
they don't contain anything,0
^,0
they\'re empty,0
they dont deserve none,0
yes,0

python is doing it under the hood when you use the + operator,0

@Kloudz.exe Select the thing which has the python pic in it,0
> > I didnt even initialize n2> @<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] n2 = Number(6) ....,0
when you run n1 + n2 python is calling the overridden dunder __add__ on n1 and passing n2 to it,0
Operator overloading,0
"> ```python> def __add__(self num2):> print(""Add:"")> return self.num + num2.num> ```This is the first time I ever mentioned num2 and it automatically initialized it and added it?!?!?!@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] are you intentionally ignoring me or ?",1
n1 + n2 python is calling the dunder __add__ on n1 and passing n2 to it both of which are number() instnaces,1
any good project idea?,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] `n1 + n2` is equivalent to `n1.__add__(n2)`,0
it's useful to keep in mind that dunder methods like _ _ add _ _ are like magic methods... it's being called automatically under the hood when you do something in this case when you run an add operator on a object of that class,1

There are a couple of issues,0
and name = Nick,0
no () or,0
look,0
where are you taking the input from?,0
If you want to get the user input (using the input function) you have to call the function. Like this: `input()`. Right now you’re not calling it (aka you don’t have any parentheses after the function),1
u have some sort of user input above those lines?,0
```input = input()name = Nickif input == name: print('Hello  + name + !')```,0
@pšeja that would be a very bad idea,0
why,0
wait yea,0
You’re overwriting the builtin function `input` with the actual input of the user. Choose another name for the variable,0
yea yea,0
i just saw it,0
like this they,0

no,0
That’s not really an answer to my questions. How are you running the code (using the terminal a built in thing in your code editor or something else)?,1

yes that's what python does,0
but in what program are you editing the code,0
what program do you open to write code,0
are you using windows?,0
then go to your cmd,0
nope,0
you have to do,0
ok,0
python nameofyourfile.py,0
@˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞ that would be fine yes and it works,0
I’d personally assign the input to a variable first though,0
yea same,0
like name = input,0
like OpalMist said,0
Like @OpalMist just showed you,0
Using an fstring is also nice,0
So you know about `.format`?,0
are you in the directory of the file?,0

it's just like,0
if you want age,0
yea,0
you don't have to do age or anything at all it's just an example,0
@˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞ adding the `f` before the string tells python that the thing would be an “fstring”. That means that anything inside the quotes following this format: `{variable}` will replace the `variable` with the value of the variable. I think my example should demonstrate this quite nicely,1

How to implement the email verification procedure,0
"@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] `__init__` is just like any other method. `ThreeDVector.__init__` accepts only one argument so `i` and `j` are undefined just like here:```pydef init(k): init(i j) # where are i and j supposed to come from? ...```You could do:```pyclass ThreeDVector(TwoDVector): def __init__(self i j k): super().__init__(i j) self.kcap = k def __str__(self): return f""{self.icap}i+{self.jcap}j+{self.kcap}""```",1
But you aren't passing in the right variables to init,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] Inheriting a class inherits all of its methods. And you _redefine_ the `__init__` method so that now it only accepts _one_ argument,1
and in the superclass also you have an error with a variable,0
you are refererencing j which doesn't exist in the super class,0
Can anyone gimme be a basic idea of email verification with a unique code,0
Not that part,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] ...but actually `ThreeDVector` should _not_ be a subclass of `TwoDVector`. Inheritance is an isa relation: `Duck` is a subclass of `Animal` because every `Duck` is an `Animal`. But a 3d vector is not a 2d vector.,1
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] Have you read the error message? What does it say?,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] Right because in `TwoDVector.__init__` `j` is not defined,0
yes... in the first class.. you reference j,0
i generate a code for the user.. store it in the database and ?,0

> That's a way but the one I am saying does not use any db@ManchaNegra you sent a link ?,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] the `__init__` method is not special  it's just like any other method. It's just that it's called when you create an instance of a class. ```pyclass Vector2d: def __init__(self i j): self.i = i self.j = jv = Vector2d(3 5)```is the same as:```pyclass Vector2d: passdef Vector2d__init__(self i j): self.i = i self.j = jv = Vector2d()Vector2d__init__(v 3 5)```or as:```pyclass Vector2d: passv = Vector2d()v.i = 3v.j = 5```,1
if I have a for loop like `for i in amino_acid` where amino_acid is a list and then I want an if statement stating if that certain value of the list is equal to something how do I define that certain value of i?,1
i[amino_acid]?,0
Well in this case where else would `self` come from?,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] Right but here it's just a function,0
```pydef sort(object1): try: return ranks.index(object1[1].lower()) except ValueError: return 1```'type object is not iterable,0
Hey @0xM4ss4cr3s0ld13rk1ll3r!,0
hey guys,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] Here:```pyclass Vector2d: def method(self x): print(self x)v = Vector2D()v.method(5)````method` is a _method_ of the `v` object so `self` is set to the instance on which you called the method (`v`). It can also be done like this:```pyVector2d.method(v 5)```,1
I'm new to coding so I don't know anything so i'm hoping to learn,0
,0
Thank you can't wait,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] No you can't call _any_ function as a method.,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] A method is a function defined inside a class.,0
no,0
It's defined outside of it.,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] In Python code blocks are marked with indentation.```pyclass Vector2d: def __init__(self i j): self.i = i self.j = j```,1
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] Yes this will work.,0

hey  simple question. I'm fluent in Python and basic HTML. Would like to render some static HTML documents that don't look like they're from 1997. I need a superlightweight templating engine that can take some really basic static HTML and spit out CSS/HTML with some simple modern attractive visual design. I've looked into Django Flash Jinja2 and a dozen others  all seem way too complex for my needs. Recommendations?,1

so look I have a list aatype = [] which has a bunch of strings like CA and oks and what not and I have a for loop like this```for i in aatype:  if aatype == CA': m = amino_acid('aa.type') mass.append(m)```And what I want it to do is everytime CA occurs in aatype I want it to take the whatever place CA is at and put it into another list which is amino_acid and then add that value to my mass listso how do I do that I bet i need to change the amino_acid('aa.type') to amino_acid[]but what do I put in that beautiful [],1

@Deleted User sockets (sockets as a concept not necessarily the python `sockets` module) are essential to understand if you want to do networking.

@Chessmaster yes dicts retain ordering. The one thing you can't do is access the first thing.,0
to do that you have to turn it into a list.,0
@Chessmaster if I give you a dict d how will you get the first thing from it?,0
Hi so I was wondering if there is anything I can do so that the pycharm shows me the execution time without importing time everytime.,1

@Chessmaster do you agree with this? dicts have order but there's one thing you can't do with them: access elements by their ordered index.,1
@Chessmaster before we debate the why let's just establish the facts. Do you see that `d[0]` doesn't get you the first element?,1
@Chessmaster You can iterate over an ordered dictionary you just can't index into it. If you want to iterate you can keep it as an ordered dictionary. If you need random access you have to convert it to a list.,1
@darklight Refrain from posting offtopic images and memes in ontopic channels.,0
@Chessmaster you can do it in an ordered list. You can't do it in an ordered dict. Try it.,0

@Chessmaster You can store data of the same type while maintaining order1) in a dynamic array2) in a linked list3) in a hash map with `index: value` pairs4) in a hash set with `(index value)` tuples5) in a binary tree 6) ...For each data structure you can make a function that gets the first element in the data structure. Do you understand why we have different data structures despite that?,1
@Chessmaster can you acknowledge that dicts are ordered in Python 3.7+ ?,0
well did you pass the correct absolute path?,0
A cat has four legs. A dog has four legs. They're not the same animal.,0
@Chessmaster great. Now: `L[0]` is always the first element of a list. There's no such expression for dicts. True or False?,1

"@Chessmaster there was a question about lists and you said list is same as ordered dictionary"". I wanted to talk about a difference.",1

@Chessmaster Dicts are never unordered though.,0
@Chessmaster but you can't use those offsets to get those values right? We just established that,0
@Chessmaster what you're doing there is iterating through the dict. Lists allow arbitrary access to any element by position. The only way you can do that with a dict is by first dumping out the entire contents which is not efficient,1
?,0
right. so if you want explicit index access you need to use a list.,0
so dicts can't do everything lists can do,0

@Chessmaster i see your point: you can iterate over the dict.,0
If you want access primarily by position use a list. If you want access by key use a dict. Otherwise you're fighting the very nature of the data structure.,1
@Ketz7 oof forgot thanks!,0
@Chessmaster we've agreed on the thing dicts can't do: explicit index access.,0

ok,0
@Chessmaster to get the N'th element of a list is O(1) of a dict O(N). Do you agree?,0
Depending on the data and the size a worse time complexity can still be faster than O(1),0
right for small input the smaller order terms can't be ~~magicked~~mathed away,0
Yea its with python and javascript @nine,0
@lakmatiol that's not what you should be comparing,0
@Chessmaster you didn't want to talk about the O(1) for lists?,0
ok,0
of course that's what asymptotic means,0
@Chessmaster not if you want the 1000th element,0
@ManchaNegra I know but I\'m responding to the fact that a person says that time complexity explains the whole story which is factually not true,1
@𝔹𝕒𝕕𝕞𝕒𝕤𝕙 no lists are not hashable,0
@Chessmaster you're free to use the wrong algorithm for the job any time but when literally everyone else in the room is trying patiently to explain to you why that's a bad idea maybe it's worth considering,1

probably simple answer,0
🤔 It should be o(1) since basic instruction take const time to run,0
@Deleted User but these are Python ints which are structures not just a machine word.,0
Yeah well I don't tell O(smth) wrt to a particular language,0
@Deleted User I tested it it is O(1),0
@Deleted User https://gist.github.com/nedbat/846b29323c389999434bf599eae9d4ae,0
@Chessmaster Really you should drop the gg thing.,0
Wow nice quick checks,0
@Captchainy Well there's no maximum integer in Python so `sys.maxint` is not a thing,0
@Deleted User if you change `&` to `%` it gets really slow,0
Yes % is too costly,0
Same as /,0
@Captchainy It's still not the biggest integer. `sys.maxsize` is completely unrelated```pyimport sysprint(sys.maxsize + 1)```,0

Okay there is a site explaining the licenses,0
@acplaygames You can read the license: <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>,0
@acplaygames it's the copyright that does that not the license.,0
the copyright is the right to copy,0
is there a way so that i can get new updates from a website to be automatically transferred to my python program i think webscraping it will do it,1
could u help,0
@acplaygames If you don't provide any license at all all the rights belong to you. So if you don't want other people to use your code at all you don't need a license.,1
@Pipe these are backticks: \\`\\`\\`,0

Nice,0
I wonder how random is random module,0
It looks great. I could give you some things to keep in mind in the future as well,0
Speed is relative to the task too,0
All variable names and comments should preferably be in English. In the future when you collaborate with others and share your code it’ll be important that everyone can understand it,1
@Aplet123 You can write C extensions to speed up certain performanceintensive parts of your program.,0
Some major libraries like numpy does this.,0
And yes C extensions and libraries help with performance,0
@Aplet123 what features are you using in 3.8?,0
Most of the high performance libraries use C under the hood,0
and what does your program do? What makes it slow?,0
!resources @Pipe,0
,0
Another thing to keep in mind is to put imports at the very top before anything else. This is the convention and makes sure you don’t use any modules that you haven’t imported yet,1
Lovely. Almost as homework I’d also recommend searching for `elif` which is basically the combination of `if` and `else`. See what you can find online,1
@Aplet123 i guess you have to choose between walrus and speed for now or explore cython,0
@Pipe One thing that would make your solution neater is if you used `random.choice()` with a list of the output strings instead of a bunch of if statements.,1
@kronos there are a few places where it is exactly the right thing I find.,0
@Pipe It chooses a random element out of a list.,0
In this specific example you could also randomize the responses if you feel like itSeems like @dementati was quicker at typing hahah,1
@Vestergurkan Sorry just trying to complement your advice.,0
I appreciate it. No need to say sorry,0
I think I would never use walrus operator,0
@Pipe So I’d also recommend searching for `list` and `random.choice` (this will let you randomize the outputs just like dementati talked about). There are a lot of great tutorials on it out there,1
Pytan,0
@Infinimata Is that a pun?,0
@Pipe might have to use that Spanish code papi.,0
@Vestergurkan ha yes,0
Si,0
I don’t quite get the relevance of the “tan” part,0
More like pychan,0
Anime style mascots use tan as an identifier,0
or pysan,0
Aah. I guess I’m just too bad at Anime hahah,0
Like MayuriSan best waifu :py_guido:,0
> the builtin range is written in C?@escaleta yes,0
@Mago Please refrain from posting offtopic images in ontopic channels such as this one.,0
@Pipe Nice!,0
Looks awesome!,0
@acplaygames If you're not actually including the library code in your code it makes no difference.,0
@Pipe Just one small thing: you’re calling the list variable `list` which is already a builtin in python. When you do `list = ...` it basically overwrites the standard thing called `list`. In short change the name of that. You could also try to make it a bit more descriptive like `answers`,1
@acplaygames Yes if you just reference another library in your code you're not reusing any intellectual property. It's still a program that _you_ wrote.,1
hey,0
true,0
maybe you'll want to license your software under GPL 🙂,0
Well it's more complicated than that...,0
For example if you're making an EXE bundle you can't include the code of a GPL library in the bundle.,0
@Deleted User we use it for @Python,0
I mostly know that we use it but I think it has something to do with Async,0
@acplaygames that’s correct. We’re not actually using a period,0
I think it’s a full stop (different Unicode character),0

You will use html css and js with any frontend framework anyway,0
They used to render content dynamically in sometimes easier way by dividing your stuff into components,0
@sahil04 i would prefer to do that explicitly rather than search for that think why it is returning int instead of float,1
@dato_z yup,0
:pydis_off_topeek:,0
Nah,0
You will end up in a js mess eventually without frameworks,0
Plus server have to do work by rendering pages and sending them to you if you don't want to use js,1
||you can do stuff in vanilla JavaScript is you wish so||,0
No frameworks required,0
Even rendering a list of items in vanilla js could be pretty hard,0
@LightSpdRunner for any nonstatic website i would say since they can be used for only certain parts of the page,0
You should know how it's done without a framework but you should always use a framework it makes your job a lot easier and frameworks are typically very well tested so you don't run into as much bugs,1
np,0
Tab in the second for statement,0
Why are there no tabs?,0
@LightSpdRunner There s no 50mb frameworks,0
And you could drop your shadows via css,0
@Doctor he's just making a point,0
I don't really can imagine a case where i wouldn't use framework except really really simple stuff,0
I like react,0
There's no reason to use eval at all tbh,0
there are examples online that show using eval,0
I don't even know what eval does,0
why?,0
(unfortunatly),0
E V A L U A T E,0
@Doctor it might be because in py2 `input` was the same as `eval(input())` in py 3.,0
Umm,0
@dato_z why not?,0
@dato_z i used to be a jQuery guy it's not been too long since I discovered react but I'm almkst certain that I'm not going back,1
well it's being useful? and why? @dato_z that's what u should ask urself,0
Yeah. in maybe x5 the code,0
But sure you can 🙂,0
Why won't we code in assembly?,0
Why not?,0
It's technically possible,0
Assembly is too troublesome to code in for my liking,0

Same with react,0

@CrumbledCookie can u send me the exercise u where doing?,0
You'll literally have to just replace input with print :d,0
@VideoCarp there's no indecies in dicts,0
@VideoCarp dictionaries have no indexing. You can convert a dict to a list which is indexable but if you do that every time you want to look something up you're better off just using a list,1
@VideoCarp Dictionaries don't have index you can find the value in a dictionary through keys,0
there's keys. If you want to check if element in dict  use key in dict,0
@Infinimata so dictionaries are good for 1 time use?,0
"@Deleted User onetime use""?",0
If you want to get the value of X key then dictionary[X] will return the value you're looking for,0
@VideoCarp can you tell us more about what you need to do with the dict?,0
@Infinimata like for index,0
@VideoCarp ok so you use the token as the key and look up the value right?,0
you'd better define your lexems with something like regular expressions (yes you can tokenize text with them why not),0
@VideoCarp that's how dicts work: `tokens[token]` will find the value for the token,0
@Deleted User well yes you can convert a dict onetime to a list and then index the list. But it's going to be inefficient to do that regularly,1
@VideoCarp i don't understand. You'll have the previous and next tokens and you can look them up in the dict also,1
@Infinimata which will be the optimal way?,0
```pythonfirst_time = Falsefor i in range(3): if first_time == True: input('Enter X parameter. ) else: input('First time? enter X parameter. ) first_time = True```@Howl Like that?,1
@Deleted User what's optimal is to pick the data structure that is optimized to the kind of access that's most common. If you're using indexing most often use a list. If you're using key lookup use a dict,1
@Infinimata there's no point in using dict imo,0
@Infinimata I see thanks,0
It gives no advantage over say  list,0
@VideoCarp i would hold onto an index so you don't need `.index`,0
@Doctor they serve different use cases.,0
@Infinimata Sure but in that case you still have to test each token,0
@Doctor if you know what keys are in the dict which is the usual use case for a dict then no test is required,1
@Doctor or maybe I misunderstand what you think the use case is here?,0
@Infinimata Probably. But i said that these keys might be more complex. Like regular expressions,0
```pythonarguments = ['x y z']all_arguments = []for argument in arguments: data = input('Input argument  + argument) all_arguments.append(data) (x y z) = tuple(all_arguments)```@Howl,1
@Doctor ok if you're trying to match against one of a number of possible regexes you could have a list and just test iteratively. Or for more advanced cases use a parser generator like Lark,1
@CrumbledCookie I reviewed ur code and doesn't make sense first if you want to find leap years u must know that:if (year is not divisible by 4) then (it is a common year)else if (year is not divisible by 100) then (it is a leap year)else if (year is not divisible by 400) then (it is a common year)else (it is a leap year),1
@Deleted User Leap years:Divisible by 4 is not divisible by 100Divisible by 100 but is divisible by 400,0
sorry chop what off?,0
In code knowing if a year is a leap year would be like:```pythonleap_year = Falseif year % 4 == 0: if year % 100 != 0: leap_year = True elif year % 100 == 0 and year % 400 == 0: leap_year = True```@Deleted User,1

Yes,0
but review the code of vanzy hahahaha,0
@appling 2016 is a leap year,0
"```:def Lists(): global Month global Day Done = input(""Are you done?: ) if Done == Yes"": if Month == 12:  Month  11 else: if Month < 12: Month += 1 if Month == 2: if Year % 4 != 0: if Day >= 29: print() print(""the Day cannot be greater then 29 if its not a leap year"") int(input(""Give me a Day (DD) between 128 for febuary: )) if Day == 28: Month + 1 Day  27 elif Year % 4 == 0: if Day == 29: print()  Day  28 Month + 1 if Day == 31: Day  30 Month + 1Date = input(""Would you like to give me a date?: )while (True): Year = eval(input(""Give me a year (YYYY): )) print() Month = eval(input(""Give me a Month(MM) between 112: )) if Month > 12: print() print(""you need to give an answer between 112"") Month = eval(input(""Give me a Month(MM) between 112: )) if Month < 1: print() print(\'the month has to be greater then 0\') Month = eval(input(""Give me a Month(MM) between 112: )) print() Day = eval(input(""Give me a Day (DD) between 131: )) Lists() print(Year,Month,Day) break```",1
This isn't about Vanzy anymore,0
hahahaha,0
divisible by 4 but not by 100 OR divisible by 400,0
Yeah everything that is divisible by 400 is also divisible by 100,0
```pydef is_leap_year(year: int) > bool: return year % 400 == 0 or year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0```,1
a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4; unless it is divisble by 100 in which case it isn't; unless it is divisible by 400 in which case it is.,1
it doesn't matter 🙂,0
Yep,0
@appling they do slightly different things for one thing,0
it depends if you have an eleement to add or a sequence of elements to add,0
a better comparison is += and .extend,0
does anyone know if theres a way to tell how many servers are running behind a load balancer?,0
@appling generally comparing operations on time doesn;t make sense because the diffeerences will be microscopic,0
There,0
There's ~10% diff between extend and += op,0
I wouldn't bother too much tho,0
it's worthwhile thinking about algorithmic complexity,0
@nedbat Yep. Time is better spent think about that then thinking about how to optimize that 1 extend operation,0
just today i made a change to fix a performance regression.,0
If you're performing a network connection that is orders of magnitude slower than anything you're doing computationally it hardly matters,0
or append,0

@Storm it might serve you better to have a gentler introduction?,0
> It makes zero sense to me at allu mean the OOP or the syntaxes?,0
How long have you've been learning tho?,0
@Storm can you give an example of something you found confusing? we might be able to help you,0
30 minutes is barely getting your feet wet,0
...,0
maybe you need to go a little more slowly and with something where you control the pace,0
again: if you want to post an example of something you're having trouble with we can help you,0
@VideoCarp it depends,0
They have like different use cases,0
^,0
@Storm yes but picking a specific thing that you're stuck with may help you get a little more unstuck.,0
@Storm you have to invest time in it to able to do anything,0
!resources,0
,0
@VideoCarp that sounds like something worth doing by way of an object lookup (e.g. a dict or even a class method),1
https://python.swaroopch.com/  this book is one of the best gentle introductions to the language I know so it might be useful,0
@VideoCarp you can use a dictionary to match things to their actions.,0
@appling smaller or equal,0
@VideoCarp essentially yes. Although you said you're writing a lexer so maybe a package like Lark might be useful  it lets you write lexers,1
@Storm you're doing very good so far!,0
yeah this is something where you need to let things sink in over weeks and months.,0
You just started getting your feet wet give yourself a little credit,0
@Storm that's why following some guided learning like the book I linked is useful.,0
```pydef square(num): return num  2```,0
@Storm `` is used to calculate powers btw,0
@Storm like ^,0
,0
Nah it's to find the whole part,0
like 5// 2 = 2,0
`//` is the floor division operator,0
```pyoptions = { 1: func_1 2: func_2 3: func_3}item = 1options[item]()```,0
@VideoCarp,0
(this assumes have `func_1` etc. defined earlier),0
Hey @Mystiganine!,0
programming an AI with if statements? a recipe for disaster,0
Is there a way that in a if condition say that: if user == to one of this numbers?,0
@VideoCarp more or less; with `result` being some function you invoke to get the result or a lambda or just the value you want,1
pattern matching is much more powerful than switch cases,0
@VideoCarp one nice advantage of using a dict is that each test is constant time no matter how many options there are.,1
pep8 says the former,0
how can I structure in the if condition a multiple conditions of a range of numbers that doesn't follow a mathematical order?,1
> how can I structure in the if condition a multiple conditions of a range of numbers that doesn't follow a mathematical order?@Deleted User can you give a little more detail about what you want,1
OOP shouldn't be required for a program that small,0
yeah but kinda with out the list,0
pep8 is the python style guide,0
pep8 is the one true pep,0
@fucdapols if you use a formatting tool like `black` you can have the code automatically formatted to conform,0
you take no other peps before that one,0
i think pep8 talks about that too,0
!pep8 a worthwhile read,0

hallo,0
@sahil04 yeah I was kinda thinking the same but thx tho,0
can someone help with this literally the first time using programming/coding what am i doing wrong?,0
,0
@Venox you are using `print` instead of `if`,0
your `print` statement should use what is returned from `is_long(tester)`,0
@𝕆𝕝𝕚𝕧𝕖𝕣 `import random; random.choice(your_list)`,0
might fault line 15 should have print,0
!docs random.choice @𝕆𝕝𝕚𝕧𝕖𝕣,0
,0
@𝕆𝕝𝕚𝕧𝕖𝕣 that is Python.,0
sets are ordered as of python 3.6,0
They are unordered.,0
really? damn,0
errrr they maintain insertion order,0
sets preserve order of insertion but do not allow indexing.,0
^,0
as do dicts.,0
Its getting to where ive been doing this long enough for my knowledge to be slightly dated,0
occasionally.,0
from a mute?,0
most likely yes @maddiesmom,0
Mainly its just from not focusing on textbook details until i have to. So if they change something im out of the loop sometimes,1
`__str__` just tells you what you get when you do `str(car)`,0
Typically you dont want to store data that will need math done on it as a string,0
you can just cast it to int if you ned to but,0
you could also just use int,0
@𝕆𝕝𝕚𝕧𝕖𝕣 you should probably not use his example word for word he was simply demonstrating that you should use `random.choice`,0
"```pyitemlist = [1,2,3,4]import randomprint(random.choice(itemlist))```",0
do you want to use `randint`,0
yeah that's fine,0
TBH ifd you're dealing with printing different dataa types anyu other way than fstrings,0
"```pystrs = [""a"",""b"",""c""]import randomprint(random.choice(strs))```",0
you are very wrong,0
`random.choice` picks a random element from the given iterable and returns it,0
same basic idea,0
You dont agree? I cant stand to see asdfdssf + str(this) + dsfds,0
it's not the only way to do string interpolation and in some cases it's worse,0
Thats fair enough. My response was highly driven by disliking the syntax which isnt all imporotant,0
its not nearaly as bad as the old C way with the %s,0
I didnt learn python until we stopped doing that,0
but i see it,0
oh yeah string formatting in a lang like java is horrible,0
they're all worse than python ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯,0
I didnt stick with Java long enough to deal with it. I quickly said This is a waste of time. if I dont have to do this there is no reason to use this lang,1
looping is pretty important,0
alright can anyone help a brother out in dms,0
i have no fucking idea what im doing rn LOL,0
@Venox you'll be better served by asking here or in a help channel.,0
alright cool 1 sec,0
you probably want the fuel to go down right,0
,0
okay with this right,0
im doing the return completely wrong i know,0
but where do i even start,0
you have a function called `check_fuel` and you run it every time fuel is used. In that function you do the math and store it wherever.,1
make sure what you want in your function is actually in the function,0
probably a better name than check_fuel for your use,0
okay replace string with course essentially,0

> @gm i mean it dosnt slow the program down to open and close the db so it doesnt matter? plus if one user has the db open another person cant update the db until the connection is closed right?@kendalk08 it does actually.,1
@CrashAndSideburns If you want a dumb data structure (possibly with some methods) you could try `dataclasses` with `frozen=True` or `NamedTuple`,0
or rather...opening a connection does have a cost,0
Seems simple but I can't think of a clean approach: call a method when a specific method hasn't been called for over 10 seconds. perhaps irrelevant context: using async,1
holy,0
> also sqlite3 supports transactions so you can have multiple processes accessing the DB simultaneously if they are properly written,0
that said it is also possible to have one connection per transaction,0
Also is there any way to parse a triple nested list,0
I believe that is Django's default behaviour (for each thread),0
Like lists inside lists of a list,0
> Also is there any way to parse a triple nested list@slither code parse how? what do you want to do?,1
@HarshitSharma that isn't even valid code...,0
> this is valid@HarshitSharma it is literally not valid.,0
You know that google doesn’t have an answer to this,0
Even stack overflow did not,0
it's not properly formatted `listtobepermuted` has weird things in it you have double commas in `originallist` and it's `itertools` not `itretools`,1
so what are you trying to do?,0
explain that first,0
Me,0
Oh,0
> Me@slither code I also asked you what you mean by parse,0
Ok,0
really?,0
So like I just want to loop over every single element of the list,0
because from your code I see things that are neither 0 nor 1,0
Triple nested list,0
unless you mean it contains numbers that only have the digits 0 and 1,0
which is something else entirely.,0
@HarshitSharma so which is it?,0
So,0
if your example doesn't match your actual data then how can you expect anyone to understand your problem?,0
> Triple nested list@slither code so basically you want to iterate over all the innermost elements?,0
is the nesting uneven?,0
Yes,0
It is,0
Which is the main problem,0
> yes I want to know which permutation number is that original number by index@HarshitSharma you just said there are only 0s and 1s,1
so which is it?,0
Me,0
because there are numbers like `10` in your example.,0
> Which is the main problem@slither code can you assume that everything not a `list` is an element?,0
> you are not understanding let me write real example@HarshitSharma like I said if you don't provide code that actually works and an accurate example how do you expect anyone to know what you want?,1
"Not really cuz it’s like this [1,[3,[4,2]]]",0
And so on,0
@slither code so you want something that yields 1 3 4 2 in that order?,0
No,0
Those numbers are just an example,0
I mean for given data,0
Yes,0
And yes I cannot use generators,0
why not,0
Hmm,0
No,0
That defeats the purpose,0
> That defeats the purpose@slither code which is?,0
The first list is a list of chunks which contain a list of blocks,0
In the chunk,0
I’m on phone rn,0
And my laptop is dead,0

> what exactly does return do?@Future it terminates the execution of a function and returns a given value if any (and `None` if not) to the caller,1
"so if you think of a function as a thing that takes inputs and turns them into an output `return` is the construct that says this is the output"".",1
hey,0
Let me explain tho so the outermost list contains the second set of lists which we can dub as “chunks” so each chunk contains a bunch of pairs of x and y coords in lists. and we need to render specific chunks at specific Times.,1
There,0
Can u help now,0
@Future for example if you created a function to tell if a number is even you could do something like:```pyif isEven(num): print(“the number is even”)else: print(“the number isn’t even”)```,1
in the definition of the function,0
anyone using sublime text 3? i need help,0
Anyway until someone answers my question I am free to answer anyone who has questions,0
```pydef isEven(num): if num % 2 == 0: return True return False```,0
Yes,0
since return statement will automatically break out of a function,0
#helpapple a simple timer is not simple,0
> Let me explain tho so the outermost list contains the second set of lists which we can dub as “chunks” so each chunk contains a bunch of pairs of x and y coords in lists. and we need to render specific chunks at specific Times.@slither code where do the times come from,1

oh lol,0
yeah mb on that,0
also in general `snake_case` for function names,0

how to do setup on sublime text 3 for py,0
Hey @asdfqwerty!,0
install sublime text,0
> It’s all based on where the player is and how much time has elapsed@slither code okay so the toplevel `list` contains middlelevel `lists` (chunks) each of which contains a number of bottomlevel `lists` each of which contain 2 elements (coordinates).,1
thats all you need,0
is that correct?,0
> thats all you need@Pedro. done,0
👍 so what do you need?,0
Yup @gm,0
python and sublime both are installed i need how to use python on sublime,0
setup,0
write code,0
Install package manager in sublime,0
and run it 🤷🏻\u200d♂️,0
Then install python from there,0
Then you can setup a shortcut then run,0
!!!wordless,0
i didnt do that and it works for me lol,0
its so hard for me,0
i am noob,0
,0
Gn,0
take the m out,0
Gm,0
good night?,0
`copy.copy` performs a shallow copy `copy.deepcopy` performs a deep copyin shallow copy we just create an object and directly assign the attributesin deep copy we are recursively copying every attributewhich one you need depends on the context as deep copy is more expensive,1
> Yup @gm@slither code ```py>>> def flatten(data):... yield from (coordinate for chunk in data for coordinate in chunk)... >>> for x y in flatten([[[1 2] [3 4]] [[5 6]]]):... print(f'x = {x} y = {y}')... x = 1 y = 2x = 3 y = 4x = 5 y = 6```like this?,1
Did you figure something out,0
and type `upgrade` properly,0
hehe,0
Will this be able to also iterate over the chunks,0
?,0
what do you mean,0
Like if I wanted to return the chunk that is being rendered,0
The index of it,0
Yes,0
is .db a thing?,0
@Pedro. upgraded !! successfully,0
yeah,0
wow,0
been making mine on .txt,0
lmfao,0
@slither code i have to build system,0
Yes,0
And,0
> Like if I wanted to return the chunk that is being rendered@slither code no,0
because you didn't say you needed that,0
you can use `enumerate` for that,0
Ok,0
> @lgneous if I change any attribute inside shallow copy then original changes  so what is the purpose  it is like assigning other variable to it  what shallow copy does then ?@SIMP no it mutates the original object if you mutate its existing attributes (eg by using methods) if you change them by doing `x.y = z` it doesn't change the original one,1
> @Pedro. you cant build databases in a .txt. but you can dump json in them@kendalk08 yeah thats what ive been doing for this time,1

btw im aware the questions arent directed at me but im trying help,0
i am noob  any one pls guid me on that,0
Try a lower level Lang,0
i wouldnt start with one too hard for a first lang,0
thats how most new ppl quit programming,0
@Future you should learn basic assembly since it rlly shows you what happens in the back,0
My first Lang was assembly,0
let the man start with whatever he's doing now rather than recommend people asm,0

I find,0
Npp,0
Better,0
> @Deleted User And your getting this issue trying to use sublime text?@Future i just started,0

thats the app,0
It’s only for static sites tho @Sedulous,0
If you want free python site hosting I’d recommend python anywhere,0
But then your site is your username.pythonanwhere.com,0
the right answer: you don'tthe actual answer: put `global <variable name>` at the top of your function,0
@enrico11011 i got it working thank you,0
LOL I PUT BRACKETS BRO,0
import(lab4_p0),0
vs import lab4_p0,0
You could also pass in the variable as a arg in the function,0
Idk it’s rlly early,0
no it's not,0
@enrico11011,0
ty for all the help bro you a real one,0
yeahh its the second,0
`global xxx` is for telling the interpreter that in the current scope `xxx` refers to the global variable,0
Also is there a key and value and ordered data type,0
`dict` or `OrderedDict`,0
depending on how ordered you need it to be,0
`str` is for human readable string representation`repr` is for representing an object as accurately as possible,0
you don't,0
Well you could use try,0
(actually you can but don't),0
Yeah,0
Use try,0
finally,0

@GaryS not yolo directly but yes,0
Theoritically how could I 2x the speed of an Ed puzzle honestly they are sooo boring,0
yes,0
Rust is old,0
yes that too there's nothing that inherently prevents object detection algorithms from detecting anything other than the general complexity of the data and the (lack of) variability in your outputs,1
rust is nice yes,0
I would still recommend machine code to someone who wants to learn how to code,0
i think everyone should at least try it,0
Go exe,0
i myself haven't used it enough but it's really nice,0
It’s literally a precopiled Lang,0
yes object detection algorithms are supposed to give you back the coordinates of the bounding boxes,0
the low and high level terminology doesn't make sense anyway,0
no you can call malloc from python does that make it a low level language,0
you can call mmap too,0
C++ has for each loops it will have typeclasses in C++20 it has ownership based memory management does that make it high level,1
you don\'t i\'m just showing examples of why saying low level or high level doesn\'t make sense,0
or at least you don't oppose them,0
a language may have some high level features and some low level features,0
it's not a 1d axis,0
depends on how much of it must be written in python to be considered written in python,0
no,0
the terminology is not irrelevant but the general view that languages are high level or low level is plain wrong,0
it's super contextual and each languages have a bit of both,0
@slither codewhy color not showing,0
,0
but you can call system calls directly too is it low level ?,0
thank you for agreeing with me,0
How do I run a method or coro when I ctrc or stop my project?,0

if you want it to do when you exit the program you can use `atexit`,0
@lgneous you're painful to tag. But ye atexit worked but not for code that uses await. I want to close an aiohttp session for context so do you suggest modifying the atexit to be async?,1
I need to call await session.close(),0
But atexit doesn't appreciate that at all,0
.,0
py?,0
yes,0
yes,0
parentheses @SIMP,0
the line above,0
"`float((input(""x cordZ""))`",0
you can't add dicts to sets,0
sets elements must be hashable dicts aren't,0
count the parentheses,0
a hash function (in the context of python's `hash`) is a function that represents an object as an int `dict`s can't be hashed,1
you guys should just ask your question rather than ask for topic experts,0
yes @𝔹𝕒𝕕𝕞𝕒𝕤𝕙,0
are your permutations just 0s and 1s ?,0
why not just represent them as integers and use an offset of `(1 << size)  1`,0
Is there any advantages of using pipenv over virtualenv ?,0
You want to find the index of something in a list ? that's it ?,0
instead of having `[[1 1 1] [1 1 0] [1 0 1] [1 0 0] [0 1 1] [0 1 0] [0 0 1] [0 0 0]]` do `[7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0]`,1
the offset part was wrong my bad i thought you wanted the left most element to be always 1 but idk why,1

if you're getting the permutations of all numbers of <32 bits you're gonna get 4  32  28 gigabytes of ram usage,1
you can't eagerly compute all permutations of such large numbers,0
really i don't get why you're doing this at all,0
you can just do `+ 1` to get to a new permutation,0
process the numbers with bitwise operations don't use lists @HarshitSharma,0
if you want the 4th bit of an int use `x & 0b1000`,0
https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators,0
btw @HarshitSharma are you still on that compression algorithm thingy ?,0
if so I suggest you get acquainted with the basics of the language before and probably also get the mathematical foundations behind various compression algorithms as this is a very nontrivial topic,1

OOh thanks,0
we all know python 2.1 is the most stable,0

do you know what an if statement for this return would be ```return 1 in temp and temp2```,0
@mark4q it could be the values that's causing the problems. tested your code with dummy data and it works well.,0
> a professional._.,0
does anyone know?,0
example ```return 1 in hand and sum(hand) + 10 <= 21``` can be turned into an expression that is not compact,1
These are not equivalent,0
close,0
Just replace the return with if and have it return True return False otherwise,0
Im getting this error while using urlopen,0
@lgneous your on the right path,0
No I mean this is the if statement version of your code,0
```if expr: return Truereturn False```is the same as```return expr```modulo casts to boolean,0

Since 20.04 comes prepacked with python 3.8.5,0
@Mrpolymath no you would need to run the program in the background,0

You basically have to find some primes which divide the number and check whether pb|n or not.,0
Perhaps you can work around something with FLT or euler's totient function.,0

so I have a class with a simple function.What is the difference between calling it using Class_name().function() and Class_name.function()?,0
i think there is no difference,0
first is instance.method,0
second is class.method,0
i guess idk,0
yay im right for once,0
^^,0
~~i feel like class methods are just lazy peeps def~~,0
it's not uncommon to have alternative constructors defined as class methods,0
method is also called functions right?,0
methods are functions but within a class,0
its a term invented to confuse noobs like me,0

but is it in the code or discord?,0
yes archie,0

that i know,0
I mean you could do it with a for loop,0
@BootyBoy i think it is open(),0
type all their names and put commas between them,0
?,0

why?,0

a screenshot,0
because I do not want to click on the image and zoom into it and look for where the code is when I can directly read from a codeblock,1

`xor` works on each bit separately if you are talking about `xor` in boolean logic then yes it is equal to `!=` but bitwise operations operate on all the bits to generate a new number,1
for instance let's take `7 ^ 5``7` in binary is `0b111``4` in binary is `0b100``7 ^ 4` is ``` 111^ 1000b011 = 3```,1
exactly,0
you can treat numbers as bit flags using `xor` to check between 2 numbers which flag (bit) isn\'t set,0
it's also heavily used in various hash algorithm,0
xor has the nice property that it is an involution as in from `a xor b` you can get back `a` or `b` by reapplying the xor operation on the result,1
`a ^ b ^ b == a``a ^ b ^ a == b`,0
very easy to verify as well,0
``` 111 < a^ 100 < b 011^ 100 < b 111 < a```,0
well you're not wrong,0
```y ^ (x ^ x)y ^ 0y```,0
funny how you have `~` for negation but actual words for other operators,0
or can you do both either way,0
yea yea i'm just curious,0
Hey @ScaryPrix!,0

@mppa what's the problem? (Always present the whole thing all at once 🙂 ),0
@Tim's business partner you want to make a dict out of it,0
@mppa `input()` always returns a string. If you want to interpret the input as a number you want `int(input())`,0
@mppa also think about your logic. `if n != 0 or n != 1:` every value of n will make this true since 0 isn't 1 and 1 isn't 0 and every other number isn't either of them.,1
you want `and` there not `or`,0
@mppa i underrstand the input is a string because you want 110101011011 as characters so you can interpret them. makes sense.,1
no need to shout,0
@mppa did you see what I said about `or` and `and`?,0

are you supposed to get 2 lines of input,0
that's not why it's erroring,0
i just got even more errors after removing them,0
it's erroring because you have two input()s but the test runner is only giving you one input,0

@Theagainmen the GIL doesn't keep your data from being corrupted.,0
nice code,0
@Shivansh007 is that from codingame?,0
@Shivansh007 isn't that cheating then,0
ok ok so now i get this,0
when i enter 30 or 15 it says both outputs,0
@Theagainmen i guess data would get even more corrupted without it but it's hard to say becausee Python wouldn't work without it.,1
but if you just have a global int and create 10 threads the repeatedly increment and decrement it you will lose some updates.,1
guys I just joined,0
@Deleted User all those conditions always trye,0
@Shivansh007 a clash of code right,0
true,0
because you could only use one integer as input,0
@BakkarBakkar looks can be deceiving 🙂,0
can I clear my python doubts hereeeeeeeee????????????,0
@Theagainmen yes,0
> true@WelTrainedTango what do you mean? if i enter 30 it should only print its payday no?,0
so shouldn't you be solving those yourself @Shivansh007,0

@Theagainmen look at this code: https://gist.github.com/c3de1404bce753ce3eb9b6f4760ea894 x should be 10 million when it's done. Try running it.,0
@Deleted User give me one counter example where `x != 15 or x != 0` is false,0
you would be correct,0
maybe change the 2nd if to elif???,0
> @Deleted User give me one counter example where `x != 15 or x != 0` is false@WelTrainedTango well in my code i have it as x != 15 or x != 30. thats any number when x isnt 15 or 30,1
> maybe change the 2nd if to elif???@Deleted User,0
so condition1 or condition2 only eval to `false` when condition1 = false and condition2 = false,0
which in this case it would mean that x =15 and at the same time x = 0,0
which is impossible,0
which would mean that this expression is always true,0
"@Deleted User using PIL```pyfrom PIL import Imageimport numpy as npdef gen_rectangle(height width filename=""output.jpeg color=(255 0 255)): arr = np.empty((height width 3) dtype=np.uint8) arr[...] = color im = Image.fromarray(arr) im.save(filename)gen_rectangle(100 100)```",1

> You mean to say if `x != 15 AND x != 30`@Spekkio yoooo this worked,0
i dont get why that makes sense though,0
like why is it and and not or,0
you could use a lock,0
nope,0
you have to explicitly lock and unlock where you need it.,0
the GIL keeps python working properly with threads. But you have to manage your own data.,0
as you can see even incrementing an int is not threadsafe,0
@ManchaNegra the GIL might be released when C code is running. Depends on the code,0
Some C code needs to hold the GIL,0
not a lot no,0
i am just comfortable with it,0
i think it will ?,0
pretty sure cuda 10 supports up to the 9xx serie,0
@Theagainmen https://gist.github.com/c3de1404bce753ce3eb9b6f4760ea894 a small change,0
#helpdumpling,0
@Theagainmen lock the data is a little off: the lock ensures that only one thread is executing within the withstatement at a time.,1

@Alberaan conda is recommended if you are using the scientific stack,0
@Alberaan conda and miniconda are only used in the context of Anaconda an entirely separate Python distribution.,0
yes,0
you usuually don't need it with multiprocessing,0
@Alberaan what part do you find troublesome?,0
@Vedran if you want an error use `index`,0
@Captchainy jython seems to be withering,0
the GIL certainly is annoying but removing it doesn't make it an automatically better choice,0
which extensions should i get for vs code,0
@Captchainy removing the GIL does not automatically make Python faster,0
@Captchainy then use Java? what can I say?,0
it certainly isn't a good thing either ...,0
use the language that fits the use case. If Python doesn't fit your use case don't use it.,0
> which extensions should i get for vs code@Deleted User python is the only one you need but there are others like indentrainbow that make things nice to look at,1
it's just that with the current state of the language most attempts at removing te GIL tanked single threaded performances,0
removing it also complexifies memory management,0
Guess I want to ask you why are you procrastinating right now instead of work?,0
> Am in 10th grade is it too late for me to learn Python@am i not at all,0
@am i there are people on this server who've learned Python in their forties,0
im in grade 11 and i started python just a few days ago,0
@Captchainy parallel code is only faster when contention for memory is not an issue.,0
yes the GIL affects parallel computing by a lot that's undeniable ...,0
@Captchainy in many cases it is an issue. If I have eight processes all trying to modify the same object access to that object has to be serialized,1
> How to get started with python??@am i look in pinned. there are a lot of resources to get you started,1
you can't slap more threads at a problem to have it fixed,0
@Captchainy if you want to use Java or C or whatever nobody is going to stop you,0
does the GIL make parallel algorithms worse ? yesdoes it change the fact that you can't make most algorithms parallel ? no,1
i used C++ for 5 months straight and i think that programming is way more fun in python,0
If you want to use Python to solve your problem we can help you do that. If you want to use another language that's a better fit go ahead. We couldn't stop you if we wanted to,1
@Captchainy that doesn't follow at all.,0
@Captchainy again this is only possible to the degree that a given problem can be made parallel. Many can't,0
~~so we ban the solutionof those that cannot be parallelized~~,0
again: you want to use something else go ahead. We won't stop you.,0
in fact C and Python work hand in hand all the time to solve many problems at high speeds,0
wtf,0
@Captchainy parallelizing doesn't reduce the total amount of work which is what determines the energy cost. this makes no sense.,0
@Captchainy I guess our question is why come in here and lecture us about it?,0
i think parallelizing actually expend more energy cuz of the thread.start() etc maybe?,0
you are doing more work than single thread,0
i could be wrong,0
@Captchainy ok but how doees that relate to parallelism?,0
@Captchainy making it parallel doesn't reduce energy costs,0
@Captchainy and again why come in here and lecture us about it? what do you expect us to do?,0
@WelTrainedTango spawning threads (or processes actually in the case of python which are more expensive) adds to the total amount of required computation,1
yeah so its even worse lol,0
@Theagainmen i don't know how to share the int among processes,0
do what?,0
JS has a GILlike lock and nobody talks about it,0
@Captchainy on a server which is running 100 programs anyway it won't matter,0
js is single threaded,0
only async,0
yes just like python,0
(modulo multiprocessing and C API),0
@Captchainy when you come into a server that is for helping people with Python and you insinuate that Python isn't all that and do so with a paucity of facts on your side you should expect pushback.,1
@Captchainy most machine learning algos use GPUs anyway,0
1) you don't use CPU cores for that anyway2) you can use C/C++ code for that anyway,0
@Captchainy it's the clock speed that is the issue not the parallelism,0
multiprocessing?,0
CUDA is de wae,0
I'm bowing out of this you have no idea what you're talking about @Captchainy,0
> if we make programs more pallel we can make less co2 intensive clock speedsYou can also use a faster language to use less CPU time 🙂,1
webserver spawns threads that run the framework,0
not the framework iteslef,0
ML algorithms that don't typically use the GPU are either unparallelizable (gradient boosting) or small enough that it doesn't matter (simple NNs SVMs KNNs),1
how do you compute primes using multithreading?,0
multiprocessing,0
run a double for loop,0
thats your solution,0
multiprocessing,0
why,0
you dont need shared memory,0
@Captchainy i understand your point: if a computation takes too long you can up the clock speed or parallize it. upping the clock speed will use more energy. right?,1
you shouldnt be doing calculations in python anyways,0
@Captchainy ok that\'s different than parallelizing saves energy,0
how do i shorten 0.(3) = 0.3333333333333333333 to just 2 digits after `.`?,0

@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] when you use the `input` command to take input from the console it blocks the thread it's running in. So the only way to do this would be to use a different input method. I concur that it might be easier to start by simply limiting the number of guesses.,1

@Captchainy to go all the way back to the beginning: don't worry about the GIL until it's proven to be a problem.,1
@Captchainy then use Java. Nobody's saying you can't,0
@Captchainy the GIL is one of those things that's easy to have opinions about and harder to actually understand.,0
@Captchainy Python has plenty of options to make code faster: third party libraries that use C/C++ Cython PyPy Numba etc. it all depends on the job in question,1
python isnt designed for performance,0
@FN Zombies don''t do that,0
@Captchainy correct,0
@Captchainy agreed although it is slightly more complex to do that than is often realized. This is where there's talk of having typeannotated Python turned into native code which is still in its early stages (although Cython has been doing that for a while just not with the standard type annotations),1
@BakkarBakkar I stopped using Eclipse a long time ago and moved to VS Code tbh,0
@Captchainy `mypyc` is one such project. And Cython is a thing right now  I threw together a Cython demo that uses Conway's Game Of Life as the testbed. The Python native version is ... not fast. The Cython version runs about 500 times faster and in about the same number of lines of code,1
~~i think slow~~,0
@Captchainy CPython has a GIL partly because of reference counting memory management. Those details are exposed in the C API so changing it would break all the existing C code. So it will be very very difficult to change CPython to remove the GIL.,1
@Captchainy The GIL has already been reworked significantly to reduce the amount of locking that takes place so it isn't like they aren't aware of these issues and don't try to do anything about them,1
unity is already kinda bad from a gamers perspective since im not a unity or other game engine dev or anything,1
3.6,0
@Captchainy but the biggest reason Python's slow isn't the GIL it's the boxing and unboxing of object types and the dynamism of objects that forces an object lookup with each reference. PyPy uses JIT compilation to speed that stuff up but not all programs benefit from that approach,1
@Captchainy no one wants that,0
maybe tiny games idk,0
@Captchainy maybe instead we can educate people about the realities of the GIL? 🙂,0
@Theagainmen no,0
@thebouv Bless pycharm it stores muliple version of the file,0
@Captchainy right but parallelism isn't a silver bullet either. It's just one possible approach. It can be used to speed up some problems but the majority are not amenable to that kind of acceleration,1
@Captchainy it doesn't need to happen,0
> @Deleted User Nice! News to me. Good find. Rescued your code?@thebouv Yeahh 😄,0
i changed the past but i got my future back,0
lol,0
@thebouv I dont want to use git for this project tbh,0
@Captchainy that's absurd that the EU would mandate removal of the GIL?,0
@Captchainy the other issue is that the gains provided by multithreading may be lost in other areas. If you have a problem that is being processed on eight threads but which requires contention for a single I/O resource (like writing to or reading from a file) then your gains in one side will be lost on the other,1
i never tried gitlab lemme try it,0
@Captchainy what would the standard require?,0
you need a git repo to use github or gitlab,0
just use github desktop,0
Oh gitlab is same as git 🤦,0
so much better than garbage git GUI or cli,0
i mean gitlab is not the same as git,0
@WelTrainedTango I think the GitHub CLI is great,0
sry i meant git cli,0
> i mean gitlab is not the same as git@✪ SavagePastaMan Whats diff?,0
Ah,0
with the desktop app you just clicc with mouse and the GUI is real nice,0
@Captchainy that's ridiculous both as a solution and as a standard.,0
@Captchainy it seems like you haven't been listening to people talking here. Parallelism doesn't make things more efficient.,0
@uncomfyhalomacro I think Git is ontopic for python since it’s an important part of the development process,0
,0
how could you ever go back to git after this,0
@Captchainy let's make a date to talk about it in ten years 🙂,0
lol,0
@WelTrainedTango i mean if you're used to git without a gui it's not that hard,0
@WelTrainedTango what’s that?,0
thats github desktop,0
@Captchainy yes but you keep bringing up threading as a solution to everything when it's not,0
lol this is such a noob friendly GUI,0
Oh. I’ve just seen its launch screen but that doesn’t look too bad. I’m a much bigger fan of the CLI though,1
but there are things it cant do like hardreset etc ithink,0
@Captchainy if your real goal is to bring down energy consumption there are far easier ways to do it like more efficient power switching and distribution systems,1
@Captchainy you just keep coming back to this canard as if nobody in the world is using threads ever and that's simply not true,1
"> @Infinimata if threading can bring down our energy usage by 10% that will be huge@Captchainy Right. IF"". it doesn\'t.",0
you could try SHA256 or write your own hash function,0
and practice some collision avoiding techniques maybe,0
as long as you guarantee all inputs gets mapped onto an output that are the same length maybe?,0
@Captchainy Which setup consumes more power: one 2000W refrigerator or two 1000W refrigerators?,0
https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HashFunction.html@vinam,0
@vinam a thread is a unit of work for a program usually tied to a physical processor in a computer. multiple threads can run multiple programs side by side and can share data (although you need to be careful). This lets you split up some classes of problems and work on them faster,1
@vinam they're useful but not magic bullets. Not everything can be threaded efficiently. But the problems that can be benefit nicely,1
> should be noted that python threads are OS threads not actual threads@ChillFish8 What is the difference?,0
that's a very specific definition of OOP,0
not many language fit that,0
@BakkarBakkar it's a style of programming where you group data together with functions that work on the data in a certain organizational unit called an object,1
hi,0

how does async differ from threading,0
quick explaination lol,0
yo is there a server like this one but for java?,0
yes,0
together java,0
@Captchainy it won't matter if the two threads take longer to run because they're now contending for memory or disk or I/O where a single thread would be efficiently serializing access to same,1
thank,0
oh,0
so where is the performance bonus if it is all in one thread?,0
@Captchainy it will if it takes longer.,0
https://discord.gg/hVtnwGd@DinVin,0
it's not necessarily a performance boost you just get to do multiple things at once,0
but you are in one thread,0
@Captchainy for reading yes. Not for writing. If you have a problem that requires multiple writes to the same region of memory those writes have to be serialized. That's a bottleneck,1
explode lol,0
is that,0
INSERT,0
i still don't understand how async allows you to run multiple things as the same time in the same thread,0

@Deleted User because by allowing custom reverse functions we allow it to be more efficient in some cases,0
in what cases,0
"Let's say you have a linked list you can implement reversed by reversing iter directly but that would consume the stream and force the iteration through the entire list we could also fallback to getitem but that would also require navigating the list at each `lst[i]` making the total complexity of reversing O n^2Or,we could use some reference to the tail of our list and iterate directly in reverse order (if we assume it is doubly linked)",1

`global lifeplayer2` @hidda.,0
grid + pack with Frame is the way I usually go about it in tkinter,0
@Deleted User .pack() will automatically adjust the size of it's children depending on what you do and what the rest of your code looks like. So we'll need to see the code to figure out what's actually going on,1

@✪ SavagePastaMan Walrus doesnt need parenthesis to work now?,0
did it ever need parentheses?,0
i think in needed ill brb,0
the priority is basically the same as the normal `=` right?,0
Yes,0
They specifically added the rule that it must be a compound expression part of a larger expression for it to work,1
To discourage its use,0
well if you want to use walrus you need the `=`,0
OMFG @✪ SavagePastaMan Some dude told me that we needed parenthesis for walrus within a comprehension and till now i was thinking it was for eveywhere lol,1
If you guys didnt tell me now i wud still be thinking it need it lol,0

@kutiekatj9 I tried making a label frame and placing the button on it but the button doesnt appear on it it instead appears above it why???,1
@Deleted User I would need to see the code to tell you,0

pack,0
people learn in different ways the best thing to do is try everything,0
it appears like,0
@Deleted User I would need to see more code than that. I have no idea how lab and frame2 are being placed in the root window,1
frame2 = tk.Frame(canvas),0
canvas = tk.Canvas(root),0
root = tk.Tk(),0
"> but that button needs to be packed into the label frame@yardshop Didnt i do that? tk.Button(lab,...)",0
lab = tk.LabelFrame(..)# in pic,0
@Deleted User `.pack()` doesn't return anything your `lab` is actually a None Type. You shouldn't stack the initialization of widgets and also the placing of widgets,1

Ooh thanks a lot for mentioning that,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] > Should you always use Object Oriented Programming?There are languages that don't have objectoriented constructs built into them (like C or Haskell) so big programs can certainly be written without using OOP.,1
technically you _can_ do objectoriented programming without classes and objects as language constructs,0
i mean that task doesn't have to use oop at all and using oop wouldn't really make that easir,0
I still don't know a good definition of what OOP is.,0
@fix error open recursion and subtype polymorphism,0
A good old super open to interpretation definition,0
@lgneous well that kind of makes sense 🙂,0
But with it you can hack together an oop system in C that fits and I'm not sure I like that despite big projects claiming they do oop in c,1
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] Open recursion is the fact that you can call other methods on the `self` variable; and subtype polymorphism means that you can make a function that works on a class and it will work on all of its subclasses.,1
did you import pygame,0
did you install it,0
@fix error since I know you like haskell I'm guessing you have some interest in type theory there's a paper I've been linked which goes way over my head that may interest you about the formalisms of OOP and how OOP and FP can be trivially converted from one to the other,1
It\'s called codata in action,0
does that talk about the codota AI thing,0
"@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] Polymorphism is the ability of a piece of code to work with data of different types. For example you can do `len(""hello"")` and `len([1 2 3])` even though `""hello""` and `[1 2 3]` are differnet types",1
@lgneous thanks I'll look at it.Well I'm pretty sure you can do procedural programming in Haskell  just make sure all your funcitons have the type `IO () > IO ()` 🙂,1
sounds horrible,0
It introduced (for me) the concept of functions as data destructors and to be fair that's a very elegant way to think of them i think,1
But again I can't grasp half of the paper,0
destructors opposed to data constructors (à la ML/Haskell),0
if you can't grasp half of it the only think I will grasp is the author list,0
the same as generating a short random number but longer,0
and no @✪ SavagePastaMan not that kind of codata rather `codata` but I am not knowledgeable enough to give you a proper understandable definition sorry,1
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28841260/whatisthedifferencebetweencodataanddata maybe this can clear things up,0
sounds interesting maybe i will take a look when i understand in a few years @lgneous,0

that's exactly what that generates,0
shouldn't it be `random.randint(263 2631)` instead ? 🙃,0

I assumed unsigned.,0
@kutiekatj9 After some workarounds i finally got it working,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] are you doing this for the sake of compatibility with some C library?,0
"```lab = tk.LabelFrame(frame2 height=250 width=250 bg=""orange red"",)lab.pack_propagate(False)tk.Button(lab height=250 width=250 text=\'TGLs\ font=(""Cooper Black 42) bg=""orange red"").pack()lab.pack()```",0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] in Python all ints are bigints in both directions; there's no practical limit on their value,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] the point is that you don't need to think about the bit depth. it's just an integer.,0
python take cares of big ints,0
thats why it becomes so slow when handling bignumbers,0
try multiplying two big nums and measure the time,0
you do need to think of ints as separate from floats though and you do need to constrain values when passing them along to `ctypes` for FFIs,1
Yeahh,0
Yeah totally,0
@yardshop Is it possible to pack that Text side by side this frame?,0
without grid it wud be tough huh?,0
hmm,0
woah,0

with place u can place anything anywhere?,0
ooh thanks but i imagine its gonna be harder than grid?,0
OOOO,0
u mean i can put a button on a button?,0
and press those 2 buttons at the same time?,0
yeah totally it wud be impossible for me to do this on my own first time,0
yeah my button blocked my label from being triggered,0
in the pack,0
it'd probably be better for the button to trigger multiple things instead of putting two buttons on top,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan can u make it trigger 2 functions simantaniosly?,0
yeah,0
"`command=lambda:list(z() for z in (lambda:a(x),lambda:b(x) lambda:c(x),lambda:d(x)))` How to make it trigger multiple functions?",0
at same time,0
yeah,0
how to make it at same time?,0
Ooh i see,0
"`command=lambda:list(_thread.start_new_thread(z,()) for z in (lambda:a(x),lambda:b(x) lambda:c(x),lambda:d(x)))`",0
this cud be made a lot more better right,0
@Deleted User Are you sure you need to trigger them _at the same time_? Why can't you just run them one after another?,1
@fix error Not that i can think of some uses right now i actually dont want it rn but what if i need it in the future i just want to be prepared,1
@Deleted User You can't really make your program concurrent by just putting threading stuff in some places. It can be quite complicated.,1
> @Deleted User You can't really make your program concurrent by just putting threading stuff in some places. It can be quite complicated.@fix error Will my code above work parallely?,1
@Deleted User I think `_thread` is some internal library that you shouldn't be using there are better ways to do this. And since you don't actually need the function to run at the same time just run them one after another.,1
What do those functions do?,0
no clue i no need to bind 2 fucntions to the same button as of now but im just asking maybe.. in case i needed to,1
and maybe.. needed to run them parallely,0
@fix error _thread isnt good?,0
i actually use only that,0
it starts with an underscore so it's something internal,0
yeah its a default python module,0
You can see <https://realpython.com/pythonconcurrency/> if you want to get started with concurrency,0
or wait i think it got the _ after it changed to python 3,0
im sure in python 2 it was thread,0
It's _internal_ as in it's not supposed to be touched by users,0
`threading` is the library for threads,0
Or you can use stuff in `concurrent.futures`,0
Aah just googled this```The thread module has been deprecated for quite a long time. Users are encouraged to use the threading module instead. Hence in Python 3 the module thread is not available anymore. However it has been renamed to _thread for backwards compatibilities in Python3.```,1
didnt know 😭,0
Yeah lol but i just didnt know that fact its not recomended to be used,0
@Deleted User Unless you're writing asynchronous code (for example running a GUI and some networking stuff at the same time) your never _have_ to do things concurrently. It's just that concurrency can (not always _does_) speed up some things.,1
@ivyroots™ルイ王 Instagram doesn't allow automating it in it's ToS so we won't help you with that.,0

@atlas_core this is what I usually do when I'm installing different python versions on my rpi <https://installvirtual.com/howtoinstallpython38onraspberrypiraspbian/> I have this guide saved/bookmarked,1
@atlas_core and I mean did you run the command `sudo aptget update`,0
yeah but what I'm looking to do is Python 3.9,0
@kutiekatj9 I tried apt however I haven\'t tried aptget yet,0
Right,0
But that a look at the guide above all you should need to do is sub in 3.9 instead of 3.8 and it should work.,1
I'm still chillin on 3.7 on my pi though,0
Yeah I'll try it.,0
@apopathodiaphulatophobia me,0
Guys,0
It matters a lot my guy,0
if i have a script that opens a file and edits a line how can i make it so opens all files in a folder and edits the line,1
You don't care but doesn't mean others won't.,0
yea,0
i have this https://pastebin.com/fQdQRHd0,0
So before you go hahaha ahsdhshhdahashdahsgduyasdg who cares about python 3.11 lmaoaoaoaoodhdhfhghgfhjdsgisddyhf us df maybe others will want that Python 3.11,1

@PotatoHeadz35 people in this server are very much proponents of precommit hooks,0

i dont think that was supposed to happen,0
@PotatoHeadz35 It makes the developer focus more about the readability of their code and instills good practices and habits. It also makes code reviews much easier,1
@USSArt convention you can change it to something like window app or whatever you like,0
y r uguys using terminal,0
because.. thats how python works?,0
i use pycharm,0
what do you mean?,0
ok but pycharm also uses terminal,0
Any IDE uses a terminal.,0
~~anyways i dont like pycharm~~,0
yeah but what i mean is that they aren't on the good looking side of the code,0
u got to get into the asthetic to smash some bugs,0
what do you mean?,0
VSCodium has that aesthetic,0
I don't understand what you are trying to say,0
Are you trying to judge people?,0
@apopathodiaphulatophobia I'll definitely take that as a judgement,0
nvrm,0
Aren't we all?,0
no im just sad,0
you aren't wrong,0
@USSArt not entirely sure about the origin of root in tkinter but my guess is you have your root Tk() instance that\'s the start of the GUI program. Everything is based off and grows from that root instance.,1
ah yes. I too yell at my computer PYLINT I\'M MAD when stuff doesn\'t work.,0
Using the ugly direct terminal look instead of pycharm is like using linux instead of the beautiful windows,0
OY,0
I LIKE LINUX AND NO ONE CAN JUDGE ME FOR USING LINUX,0
linux is good,0
@Destinatio Just let people use what they want to use. You can make terminal linux windows or whatever look however you want.,1
windows is still the master race tho,0
But linux is ugly (except for kali linux),0
thats like saying ew apples bad (except the red ones),0
try KDE.,0
@Destinatio well let's get back on topic since how aesthetically pleasing linux is for you isn't ontopic for this channel,0
#datascienceandai,0
oh yeah,0
linux is an OS kernel it doesn't look like anything,0
anyway uh my pip is broken,0
,0
@D. 🔮 you are running the loop once for each element but using counter+1 on the last iteration,0
r/windowsporn shows way better desktops then r/linuxporn list one aspect linux is better at other than customization and privacy,0
@D. 🔮 what is this code trying to do?,0
"Question...```py await db.execute(""""""INSERT OR REPLACE INTO User_Schedules (? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?) VALUES (? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?) (attr attr))```How can I do this so it doesn\'t raise a syntax error?",1
@Destinatio customization and privacy,0
@Isaiah The Greatest you are trying to use the same thing as the name of the columns and the values to go into the columns?,1
Besides this is offtopic.,0
> r/windowsporn shows way better desktops then r/linuxporn list one aspect linux is better at other than customization and privacy@Destinatio I seriously doubt that.,1
cause they have the same names cause that's how I set it up 😎,0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^,0
Linux itself is a kernel people,0
all it says is sqlite3.OperationalError: near ?,0
KDE is great and no one will change my mind,0
@Isaiah The Greatest that doesn\'t make sense: Your SQL would always be insert into schedules (a b) values (a b),0
the advantage of gnu/linux distros is that you have a huge number of OSes to play with,0
"> @Isaiah The Greatest that doesn\'t make sense: Your SQL would always be insert into schedules (a b) values (a b)""@nedbat ?",1
@Isaiah The Greatest what is in `attr` ?,0
I'm absolutely sure that there is a linux distro for everyone,0
"```pyfor user in self.users: attr = [x for x in dir(user) if _ not in x] await db.execute(""""""INSERT OR REPLACE INTO User_Schedules (? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?) VALUES (? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?) (attr attr))```",1
how would i fix a broken pip?,0
@Deleted User (this is offtopic but not if you're into heavy design work),0
@Isaiah The Greatest so you are using the names of attributes as the values. that's not what you want,0
you really can't compare Linux to Windows,0
Because once again linux is a kernel,0
you'd compare it with DOS or whatever,0
> Just install an os@apopathodiaphulatophobia ok then i'll install Windows Chicago,0
@Isaiah The Greatest also i'm not sure you can use parameter substitution like that for the column names.,0
> @Isaiah The Greatest so you are using the names of attributes as the values. that's not what you want@nedbat Why not?In my table I set it up and my class as the same way,1
Oh... fair,0
then L,0
@Isaiah The Greatest you aren't accessing the Python values anywhere there,0
> @atlas_core and start programming@apopathodiaphulatophobia why my web brwoser no work !!!!!!,0
anyway,0
Noted,0
offtopic discussion over,0
my pip3.9 is broken how do i fix it?,0
sigh... manual it is then,0
thx ned,0
Why do you need Python 3.9?,0
Stick with the stable release channel,0
I would like staying uptodate.,0
@Isaiah The Greatest you could build the string you need from dir() if you wanted. but you can't use `(attr attr)`,1
How would I recompile and reinstall Python 3.9?,0
I was gonna say isn't 3.9 stable now?,0
3.9 has been done for a week,0
im running 3.9 how do i write an input i forgot,0
Aite... thank youuuu,0
Reminds me of the C language,0
wheres TrueTrue that would mean 2?,0
You had to import a booleans library in order to use the usual True/False,0
And not 0 and 1,0
How long have you guys been coding.,0
a few months,0
around since 2020 I have had started writing Hello World programs in a few langauges,0
before ultimately settling on Python,0
Happy 2 year pyversery,0
I still suck at programming,0
not really,0
@Destinatio be careful with that question: don't use the answers to judge your progress.,0
i just did that to familiarize myself with programming,0
@D. 🔮 lists don't have lines.,0
> you can print hello world in any programming languages@dewi Not really,0
and seeing which language was the best,0
answer: we all know the answer,0
yeah is javascript,0
@D. 🔮 yep. You probably just want to print your list in some kind of way that you want,0
python.,0
@D. 🔮 are you asking how to print a list to look like that?,0
There are languages without the print method and without any option to create your own,0
jp,0
i can't name any,0
obviously they aren't popular,0
or used in any way,0
anyfreakingways my pip is still broken how do i remove recompile and reinstall it?,0
Which OS are you using @atlas_core ?,0
Raspbian,0
I'm pretty sure getting any python version on a raspberry pi above python 3.6 is a pain in the ass,0
,0
@Deleted User Correct.,0
@atlas_core what command/code was it that caused that error?,0
pip install numpy,0
yeah but how do I specifically remove pip?,0
guys i just started coding,0
its pretty cool,0
you could delete all pip related files and symlinks,0
and then use ensurepip to reinstall it,0
Is there a numpy binary for 3.9 yet?,0
it was just to show an example of what pip would do.,0
literally anything will do this error,0
hm,0
I wouldn't recommend using python 3.9 anyways,0
Not until everything is updated and well tested,0
what changes in 3.9 break existing packages though,0
guess i'll try removing 3.9 entirely...,0
.. if I know how.,0
Try pip install pandas,0
I know pandas just released 3.9 support,0
yeah but what breaks them,0
@kutiekatj9,0
ik that,0
Back in the days there was an anaconda fork which i believe had an uptodate python version,0
specifically for raspberry pis,0
i don't know if it's still there,0
@dewi isn't 3.9 stable now?,0
> Depends. Sometimes they break due to new reserved words. Other times due to use of deprecated features.makes sense thank you my friend,1
3.9 is stable there just aren't many libraries that have binaries for it yet,0
Not having library support doesn't make it not stable,0
But... that doesn't make the current release not stable,0
@atlas_core what does `python3.9 m pip install pandas` get you?,0
@dewi problems with Python itself? Did you report bugs?,0
how do you calculate the average of numbers?,0
alright,0
`.mean()` function =3c,0
divide what by what?,0
switch average and the expression around,0
almost,0
x+y+z,0
lol,0
quick question,0
yep,0
x+y+x /3= x/3+y/3+z/3 not average,0
um what?,0
lol,0
what,0
> @atlas_core what does `python3.9 m pip install pandas` get you?@kutiekatj9 same thing as usual,0
i have a function that returns True on a condition. If the condition is not met will it be False? Or do i have to add an extra else statement and make it actually return False,1
what is your function,0
def is_app(file): if file.endswith('.app') and path.isdir(file): return True,0
ah,0
Sorry for no code blocks,0
You learned functions in 9th grade use your noggin please.,0
> Your function will return `None` which evaluates to `False` in a boolean context,0
thanks,0
what you could do is `return file.endswith('.app') and path.isdir(file)` @Deleted User,0
Delete and redownload python and you might also have to edit your code,0
```pyPython 3.8.6 (default Sep 30 2020 04:00:38) [GCC 10.2.0] on linuxType help copyright credits or license for more information.>>> bool(None)False>>> ```,1
@dewi use `python3.9 m pip` to be sure,0
`editing main.cpp`traitor,0
@atlas_core It might be best to do a 3.9 reinstall,0
wdym errors,0
I'm currently installing 3.8.6 since 3.9 is causing a lot of problems for me.,0
ah,0
@Destinatio isn't `(x + y + z) / 3` the average of x y z?,0
@atlas_core but you should check what libraries support 3.9 before deciding to go to 3.9 if you rely a lot on external libraries,1
what do you use to edit code @cyclops29,0
ah,0
^,0
@kutiekatj9 All I rely on is Discord.py and Discordrpc for now which all work under Python 3.9,0
wait,0
what does discordrpc do,0
it's a Discord Rich Presence Client,0
yeah,0
@atlas_core discord.py doesn't have a binary for 3.9 though I thought,0
yeah i add useless garbage gimmicks to my bot.,0
!resources,0
,0
!resources is great,0
,0
rip i lost,0
good idea wrong execution,0
bit unrelated to python but does anyone know if the Discord client supports arm64 devices?,0
@dewi next is 3.10,0
@nedbat I wouldn't know I'm doing Math 1 rn.,0

yoo same,0
@Destinatio ok then don't tell people they did average wrong if you don't know how to average.,0
turtle is cool,0
turtle go brr,0
I was joking stop bugging or I'm going to delete your code. @nedbat,0
3.11,0
@Destinatio people can't tell you are joking.,0
python 6.9 will be the greatest edition ever,0
why,0
@sleepcult No.,0
hello my firend,0
another quick question.Does a static method in a class mean that you don't pass `self` or `cls` to it?,0
yep,0
Only when i'm here people start to act a little weird. It's called the carbanaro effect. @sleepcult,0
thats a tv show,0
;_;,0
Imma get back on topic now what were we saying.,0
Oh yeah python version 4.0,0
i doubt we'll see python 4 any soon,0
rip,0
We'll have python 3.10 after 3.9 just saying,0
you can download Python 3.10.0a1 right now,0
I'm glad spent my life savings on my coding books becuase I don't learn well with youtube.,0
Don't want them to get outdated too quickly.,0
Wait arent the additions of .1 a major bug fix or new software update while .01 are the small bug updates.,1
it can vary,0
https://semver.org/,0
Good thing I like reading.,0
I prefer googling problems when i'm stuck,0
It's not,0

if i have a script where i am manually setting the file name how can i make it so like if i drag a txt file over the script it will run the script on the file,1
As within so without the paradigm functions as a sort of panopticon for the code that allows the programmer to in a sort view all of his code. In other words use two monitors.,1
> if i have a script where i am manually setting the file name how can i make it so like if i drag a txt file over the script it will run the script on the file@Deleted User Most terminals let you drag a file inside it. That will return a path,1
Pickle isn't a database,0
You could still store a lot of things in pickle,0
can somone tell me if this course i want to attend is worth for 99 euros,0
no course is really worth a hundred euros,0
@Deleted User but how do i pass that into a function,0
,0
is that to me kendalk,0
Hello I am the bot John ask me anything and I can answer.,0
> @Deleted User but how do i pass that into a function@Deleted User That should be easy. You can use sys.argv to get the path to your file,1
well I live in kosovo. And I'm not gonna get a CSE degree until 23 years. So a certificate of Python Training would be a VERY small plus,1
am I allowed to post links here ?,0
so you could do something like `python3 yourscript.py <drop your file here>`,0
If it is relevant yes. @Deleted User,0
I just want some of your input guys on that course,0
Yes it can,0
you could do 123,0
What will be learned :• Variables expressions and statements• Functions• Case study interface design• Conditionals and recursion• Fruitful functions• Iteration• Strings• Lists• Dictionaries• Lists• Dictionaries• Tuples• Files• Classes and objects• Classes and functions• Classes and methods• Inheritance54 hours (3 days per week 3 hours per day) 6 weeks99 Euros.,1
that doesn't sound like it covers much,0
"so if i have like ```def get_manpower(phrase file_name): with open(file_name) as f: for i line in enumerate(f 1): if phrase in line: return i line.split('=')[1].strip()```i can just go `manpower = get_manpower('manpower =',str(sys.argv))`",1
Pretty basic stuff i'd say,0
Just torrent a udemy lesson.,0
jkjk,0
yes I know it's for begginers. But it gives a certificate of completion from ICK. Which is possibly the best thing second to university in my country,1
`sys.argv` itself is a list of all arguments passed to your script i think,0
What exactly are you saving though,0
idk about there but in the US u just need to be competent and have expirience to get a programming job.,1
i have a script that edits a line of a file but i need to do it on all files in a folder,1
I didn't know you could store objects in a pickle,0
Oh just the integer?,0
Well I want to start learning Python from 1st of November and I'm aiming for an internship somewhere around April. Is that possible without a degree,1
That would work for sure but it's not the greatest approach,0
I don't have anything on my resume so that certificate of completion would be just a small plus for me,0
And defs not the most efficient,0
also keep in mind saving things to an external pickle file every second can make it inaccurate in the long run,1
@J_ustCJ what exactly are you trying to do btw,0
@LightSpdRunner could I do that with: HTML CSS PHP not too much Python for backend. (in that same timespan i mentioned) ?,1
I work as a career associate scanning professional.,0
You're making a discord.py bot right?,0
and vanilla JS sorry my bad,0
there is a discord for discordpy,0
hmu if you need help with your bot. I've made quite a few discord.py bots,0
no,0
i am in it,0
i am just saying that is bc its not on mutual servers for u,0
His questions weren't discord.py related though,0
Their lol,0
6 months is cutting it close. People have gone from no programming knowledge to getting a job in a year but that also required a lot of hard work.,1
Has it?,0
more than half of the code is comments lol,0
@LightSpdRunner from what I researched in multiple forums and online resources I can learn how to create a website using; html css basic JS basic php in +/ 4 months. I guess that sounds impossible.,1
ghost ping nice,0
Should you use del x when you're finished using a list for better memory performance?,0
How come my school didn't teach us python lol,0
lucky lad,0
@Deleted User I think that will rarely matter at all.,0
he's very good at his job,0
That's generally the way you wanna do it yeah. Everything in a single function isn't very readable,0
> How does the garbage collector look like? Is he a nice guy?@The Liar he says hi to me every day,1
Yeah I know that but I meant is it faster to do that than just leaving it to the garbage collector?,1
Not really.,0
i thought python didn't have a garbage collector?,0
It will presumably go out of scope soon after anyway.,0
@Deleted User It does.,0
5 less lines of code then,0
6,0
Then what would you say is the best approach to start coding Python or more frontend developing?,0
I mostly use python as a shellscript on crack,0
@LightSpdRunner yes but lets say after I get a grasp on the basic concepts where do I go from there. I'm certain that I can't even get an internship with an empty resume and no degree.,1
You start off with python. Then you go on to learn extra programs,0
@dementati so if I have a list and I make a generator out of it and that list will never be used again Python automatically releases it's memory?,1
Python imo isn't really a good first programming language,0
There's tens of hundreds. I feel lost whenever I type coding for beginners in google.,0
Ok well I suggest you start off with Python then move onto C#,0
@Deleted User i\'m not sure what you mean by make a generator out of it but if the list isn\'t referenced it will be reclaimed,1
Why C#?,0
That seems way to specific,0
Or you go to college / school or take a higher degree in software engineering or whatever area you are getting into,1
@nedbat ```pya = [1 2 3]a = iter(a)```,0
@Deleted User why don't you think it's a good first language?,0
C# is a very good language for object orientation,0
Whereas python sucks ass at it,0
But not the only one. There's also C++ that can be amazing,0
Or Java,0
@Deleted User that will still reference the list,0
C++ is also very good,0
Java is similar to C#,0
"@Deleted User can you explain what you mean by sucks ass at it""?",0
> @Deleted User why don't you think it's a good first language?It doesn't teach you a lot of things that a language like C++ does.,1
so I have to make a deep copy of the list and THEN it will be collected?,0
@Deleted User do you need those things?,0
@Deleted User why do you want the list to be collected?,0
Well in a sense uh python just adds a bunch of unknown lines in order to process the object orientation in a sense.,1
There are about 10 lists of 60k items on each,0
pretty heavy,0
@Deleted User unknown lines?,0
wanted to make generators out of them,0
@LightSpdRunner Yes I get that but the problem that I'm facing is this.1) I learn HTML CSS basic JS python. (So basically I learn JS Python)2) I have no degree and no experience. 3) ???4) Ask Discord,1
C# just makes it so much easier to understand,0
Some areas python is better,0
Some areas C# is better,0
@Deleted User ok but making a deep copy will just duplicate the memory,0
Some areas JS is better,0
Some areas etc etc etc...,0
why are you comparing these 3 different languages,0
Then what's the best way to make a generator out of that list and them completely remove that list from memory?,1
I prefer C# with object orientation,0
C# Python JavaScript barely have anything in common,0
it is easier for me,0
@Deleted User make your iterator and then consume the iterator.,0
@Deleted User I think you need to understand what I said kiddo,0
They have their own areas,0
ooh someone's spicy,0
That's all? oh...,0
thats an out of context thing to say,0
Some programming languages will make it easier in some specific subjects.,0
Others will have it harder,0
but we're talking about oop in python,0
Yep and C# is in no way a better language to learn OOP than C++,0
So your whole argument makes no sense,0
@LightSpdRunner Thanks for the information. Appreciate it a lot. Can't wait to get into JS and Python.,0
@Deleted User you started with OOP which Python is fine at. I'm not sure where you see the gap.,0
I just told him to learn a few programming languages not sure where you are coming from either,0
I like variation let's just say,0
@nedbat I thought either the garbage collector would do it or ```pydel a[:]del a```,0
I don't like to stick to a specific language for more than a month,0
uhhh you said> Whereas python sucks ass at it@Deleted User,0
or couple of weeks if I have to,0
Just because you like something doesn't mean it's better for everyone,0
@Deleted User you said Python sucks ass at [OOP],0
ah yes i like kde so everyone must use it,0
You sound like a 13 year old kid honestly.,0
Maybe I worded it wrong. Let's just say it is harder to program object orientation in python than it is in C# better for you?,1
It is not harder,0
It's actually easier,0
and also using a lang for only a month is a great way to learn basic syntax of a bunch of langs but not learn deeply about any one lang,1
May not be for you but it is for me,0
Personal preference,0
what is an OOP,0
@Deleted User i was just trying to get details about what you felt was lacking in Python's OOP.,0
Your personal preference != what everyone should learn,0
I really want to learn JS or C# but then I think about how I'm just average on Python and just stick to Python,1
> Well in a sense uh python just adds a bunch of unknown lines in order to process the object orientation in a sense.@Deleted User especially this message,1
I hear from people on my course that it is harder to code it in python than C# so I am just going off what they said. If it comes down to me I will choose python over C# for Most Areas but not all of them,1
oh so you heard it from someone,0
that must mean it's true.,0
I think you misunderstood Course,0
They are good friends of mine,0
any examples?,0
> that must mean it’s true.@Deleted User this tho,0
i heard the covid19 is a beer so it's inoffensive.,0
if you dont have any evidence,0
Oh yea they are your friends. that must make them very experienced in the field of OOP programming!,0
archie be trollin,0
@Deleted User we should drop the sarcasm,0
@Deleted User Why are you getting so triggered? It's just coding stop trying to suck off python because that's all you know.,1
chill out guys keep it civil,0
Never said Python was better than x,0
@Deleted User let\'s relax. you said sucks ass and people have been asking you about it.,0
It's not the easiest,0
lmao no,0
cough scratch cough,0
> Python is the easiest language in the world@Slow dogs:,0
Right my bad I take back suck ass statement. Sorry.,0

make sure to make use of all your available CPU threads while building it,0
@SFM61319 I mean that's trivial though,0

Looks like they're on windows,0
Try installing that module again,0
@Whiteout any clue?,0
What'd it say?,0
I’m talking about something as simple as cookie clicker,0
Something for myself just a simple solo project with a currency,0

what does rpc do?,0
honestly idk even know what flask is,0
I just know basics like OOP and stuff,0

@Higgs the constructor is called when the object is made: `Person()`. Assigning it to a variable doesn't construct the object it makes the variable refer to the object you just made: `p = Person()`,1

Hi I am trying to create a python web scraper using requests but unfortunately the website I am trying to scrape is protected by Incapsula. I found this GitHub https://github.com/ziplokk1/incapsulacrackerpy3 but the code appears to be out of date and doesn't work anymore. Does anyone know how to bypass incapsulate with Python requests?,1
Split remove or something,0
"basically split(""{}"") but including the item inside",0
or maybe i can use regex,0
lmao sure @Sin,0
its just a string,0
@Higgs yes `p = Person()` constructs the object but it's not the assignment that does it.,0
i don't want to format it,0
just split the string with { and },0
@Higgs don't worry about `__new__` and allocation etc. The `__init__` method is the constructor and it's called wheen you make an object,1
In #helpdumpling im trying to crack incapsula if anyone wants to help,0
@Sin what have you got so far?,0
me,0
dont ask to ask,0
Hey @FlavorIsNice!,0
well if there's only one f the first and last index are the same,0
@Aboo Minister you forgot a return statement someplace,0
oh nvm yeah you're right,0
link us to the code and full error,0
@Aboo Minister that's not all the code,0
it's so that your debugger stops at that line so you can inspect the state of your program,0
@Raf please don't use that word that way,0

@Aboo Minister what happens after line 49 if it isn't PLUS or MINUS?,0
generally empty containers are falsy and not empty containers are truthy @Raf see my code example above,0
@Aboo Minister can you share the entire error report?,0
oh sorry i see it,0
i mean it doesn't have to be one line,0

@Aboo Minister not sure what's going wrong. You should print out more things as it's working.,0

and that's why you don't do that,0
I have a probably very dumb question,0
if a function foo() appends items to a list fizz and a function bar() makes operations on each element on fizz,1
If I use threading on both functions they basically have shared memory,0
is there an instance that algorithm would fail with multithreading?,0
@Aboo Minister wherever you aren't sure what's going on,0
just for example```pyfizz = []def foo(lst): for item in lst: fizz.appent(item)def bar(): for item in fizz: print(item2)```,0
@Deleted User you have to use locks if you want that code to work properly,0
@Deleted User but why involve threads?,0

no?,0
I stand corrected actually. it does work,0
well if it's a decimal I don't think it works,0
10.5,0
but the x<y<z approach is probably fastest since it only has to make two comparisons,0

how?,0
> @Deleted User the kind who uses both depending on which type of quote I need to escape in the string@Infinimata,1
"there\'s no difference between `""` and `\'`",0
it depends on the context honestly,0
yea,0
save for the fact you can enclose one within the other,0
@Infinimata the `in range(...)` check will be O(1) with `int`s but `a < b < c` is still better here.,0

Why would any python programmer care about memory usage lol,0
LOL,0
I'm not saying python doesn't use up lots of memory,0
That solely depends on the program you're creating,0
but python programmers don't usually think about the low level stuff,0
plus this isn't 1982 and we're not dealing with 640K system memory.,0
"```pythonn_list = [""Happy [2 0 1 5]]print(n_list[0:5][0:2])```Why when I put [0:1] in the [0:2] it only prints Happy why?",0

@Deleted User,0
remove the outer loop,0
or fix the inner loop,0
since every iteration,0
i'll compleatly redo the whole thing since i have no idea what i made,0
Take for example: ML first you familarize yourself with numpy then learn some basics of scipy move to sklearn even you are just dealing with linear regression and knn the things you have to thouroughly understand is hard.,1

Cmd,0
@NodeJS what is,0
On windows type cmd in the search bar,0

Although Window's command line is a joke,0
Use powershell,0
I'd recommend you to install the official Microsoft terminal. It combines Powershell and cmd into a single app,0
guys,0
shift right click then open powershell window here,0
And it doesn't make the shell any better it's still a joke. But it does provide a better UI,0

@Titus Axton I think elementary number theory by burton is a good start,0
I think coding interviews preparation books are also great,0
syntax error,0
haha,0
@Titus Axton if you are good with maths then try this it's very basic competitive programming for high schoolers https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf,0
expected an indent block,0
lol,0
No,0
but C++ is pretty good for competitive programming,0
art and craft of problem solving by paul zeitz is als good,0
@Captain Quail visual social learner I think you mean auditory learner?Also everyone is somewhat a kinesthetic learner since after you\'ve learned from the book you have to use it practically which is a subset of kinesthetic learning,1
@Titus Axton don\'t worry about the programming language,0
just learn math basic syntax and the important libraries such as MATH Library Standard Library,0
@Titus Axton It's not hardcore C++ it's nearly psuedo code so you don't really need to know c++,0
In tkinter i make buttons like this``` for i in range(len(photos)): tk.Button(frame2 image=photos[i] command=lambda: setmsg(gds[i])).pack()```but when i press the button it runs setmsg but the parameter is always the last element in the gds why is that?,1
Also competitive programming is much better in Java and C++ both for efficiency and writing so if you want to fully commit to competitive programming python is definitely not the best choice @Titus Axton,1
@Deleted User what are you trying to get it to do?,0
@Captain Quail What is your point here? Some people are better at other learning methods so what? I still think reading is superior no matter what else your prefer you can't change my mind on that on top of that people rarely give books a chance so you can't just assume that it's not the optimal learning method for them when they refuse to give it a solid attempt,1
@Titus Axton It is but it's not the best for competitive programming,0
Yeah I wouldn't use java for comp programming,0
lmfao why,0
It forces you to use OOP,0
@kutiekatj9 Normally if i press button 1 it shud run setmsg(gds[0])and button 2 shud run setmsg(gds[1])and button 3 shud run setmsg(gds[2])and so on...but all the buttons run setmsg(gds[9])there are 10 buttons so gds[9] is the last onei used``` for i in range(len(photos)): tk.Button(frame2 image=photos[i] command=lambda: setmsg(gds[i])).pack()```to create the buttons,1
literally every top cp competitor uses either c++ or java though,0
+ slower than C++,0
barely,0
it's still much faster than python,0
c++ and java are the main used ones just because you don't prefer it doesn't mean professional competitiors dont use it lmao,1
however no one uses python,0
just because you don't use python doesn't mean no one uses python,0
@Deleted User ah okay. The problem is the lambda and the way lambdas work,0
I've seen people use it,0
ooh,0
a lot of people,0

How familiar are you with lambdas and when they execute? vs something like partials?,0
@Deleted User https://ioinformatics.org/Show me bro,0

@kutiekatj9 This works``` for i in range(len(photos)): tk.Button(frame2 image=photos[i] command=lambda r=gds[i]: setmsg(r)).pack()```,0
@Deleted User Here are a few stack overflows that'll explain it better than I can. Lambdas aren't my strongest area. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39174661/tkinterbuttoncommandsinforloop><https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28494089/howtounderstandclosureinalambda>,1
Ok thanks ill look into that,0
But variables with lambdas are only resolved when the lambda itself it executed,0
Actually even check public rankings of professionals like on codeforces; https://codeforces.com/ratingsor any other platform @Deleted User,0
how to make custom error,0
The lambda is only executed after you iterate through your for loop so it'll always be the last element,0
> But variables with lambdas are only resolved when the lambda itself it executed@kutiekatj9 Ooh i see thats why,0
i forgot what to subclass,0
No i mean make my own,0
Custom error,0
I think partials would actually solve it because they freeze the input when you declare them @Deleted User,0
Oh yeah missing the capital E,0
Usually partials fuck up my code and I have to switch to use lambdas because of that,0
> I think partials would actually solve it because they freeze the input when you declare them @Deleted User@kutiekatj9 partials return a function then i assume?,1
or to be more accurate usually I incorrectly asses I need a partial and I actually usually need a lambda,0
@Titus Axton No but people who competitive program tend to use either far manager vim emacsbecause they love shortcuts and whatever typing method they have. But it's not a requirement,1
hmmmm,0
i never knew about partials,0
@Deleted User sort of. Partials return a `partial object` which will behave like a function.,0
ooh,0
yes,0
ok ill try to understand it by looking into sum more examples,0

I'm executing some shell code using `os.system`,0
perhaps it is. I like the readability of os.system though,0
The code isn't being run on anything other than my computer anyways,0
I believe os.system isn't recommend because of security flaws,0
Is that true?,0
no,0
subprocess is superior in every way,0
not completely,0
What's so bad about it if not security?,0
subprocess api is better,0
and doesn't require spawning a shell,0
anyways... If my computer won't blow up using `os.system` and gets the job done with readable syntax it's fine,0
you can read stdout stderr etc,0
pass stdin,0
avoid using a shell,0
instead of os.system,0

it won't but you can still cause some chaos without admin perms,0

You can do `rm vrf /` and it will reversedelete most user files and some system files without admin perms,0

v stands for reverse which means it will go for user files first,0

About to start coding on a old laptop to save space on my gaming laptop,0

It's running windows 8.1 which is fine but im gonna update it anyway.,0
depends on how many m2 slots,0
and sata connectors,0
:logo_pypy:,0

I want that space for future games and games i want to develop soon before investing in a PC,0
Unless you're doing graphics programming or you're hosting databases on your laptop you're not gonna fill 457GB,0

quick question what's the syntax for static methods in a class?,0
i recall there's some decorator for that,0

If the software connects to the internet it's most definitely vulnerable,0
So many people wanna hack. smh.,0
lol damn igneous,0
There was a new WebKit software exploit released that compromises iOS 14.0.1 security on all iPhones,0
Visiting a website could get you a keylogger installed on your phone,0
nice,0
Every 2 years iPhones get compromised by a single Unicode character so it's not too surprising,0
haha true. That's mostly thanks to the jailbreaking community,0
I do,0
no this is the proDOS focus group,0
where we talk about our addictions to DOS,0
I'll search for it.,0
Was on r/jailbreak just this morning,0
pride,0
and GNU,0
everything really,0
Meanwhile android has hella vulnerabilities. Fuck with android fuck apple.,0
Android has even more vulnerabilities than iOS does,0
Yeah,0
mess with it,0
Both are getting hacked every week though,0
by some 14 year old with a chromebook,0
now if i hacc the 14 year old i could hacc him to hacc these devices,0
:py_guido:,0
> Android has even more vulnerabilities than iOS does@Deleted User agree,0
iPhone hardware security is no joke though,0
U can find exploits on internet for ur telephone,0
Pointer authentification SEP etc,0
ubuntu for windows like GUI,0
iPhone hardware is a tough nut.,0
Yea hahahaaha,0
or fedora cuz I is fanboi,0
I just want to have iphone,0
Its secured at alll,0
It's not as secure as apple markets it,0
if you are linux noob like me just ubuntu cuz thats the ~~noobs choice~~ linux distribution,0
Like android is just for root and noft else,0
I'm sure some 13 year old nerd has a 0day that can compromise every single iPhone and inject malware into all of them,1
Hahahahahahah me to,0
thats why i use calculators instead,0
zero compromises,0
:logo_pypy:,0
There is also a Blackbird SEP exploit that coupled with a bootROM exploit could be used to unlock and even access data from locked phones,1
@Urkchar not that good with pseudo code 😆,0
no. no. no. No ubuntu,0
ubuntu flavors like kubuntu are way better but i'd still prefer not to have any Canonical crap on my computer,0
Canonical is known for selling your private data to Amazon for adware,0
Pop os is good,0
Kubuntu is just Ubuntu with KDE instead of unity/gnome,0
Not \\just\\ that but almost,0
Gnome hmmm,0
And calling KDE way better than gnome is a stretch,0
"```python if checkEmail(email) and formPassword: user = User.query.filter_by(email=email).first() if user: # If there is user with the email used in the login form then. if flask_bcrypt.check_password_hash(user.password formPassword): login_user(user) return json.dumps({\'status\': True}) else: return json.dumps({\'status\': False \'message\': \'The password you entered is incorrect\'}) else: return json.dumps({\'status\': False \'message\': The account doesn\'t exist please sign up""}) else: return json.dumps({\'status\': False \'message\': Please enter a valid email and password""})``` Is there a way to not have this many conditionals ?",1
It also gets rid of some of ubuntu's bloat,0
What's different then  uh no it doesn't,0
Try getting rid of Snaps on stock Ubuntu,0

yes,0
i ask questions here all the time,0

It has everything you need. If the installation process seems too much I'd recommend you to use Manjaro instead. It's very much like Arch,1

nope,0
And the Ubuntu crashed up and i had to install it again,0
its not joining,0
Idk what u want to join,0
Im confuesd now,0
`print( .join(x))`,0
wait let me show you,0
i want to do like this on my x,0
Why did u put ``print_(x)``,0
I am confused,0
Me to @Deleted User,0
You wanna do what to your X ? man,0
I've destroyed my operating system installation,0
@Deleted User cool,0
thanks to my python program,0
if i want to join x without comma what will be the syntax for that?,0
oof,0
so it's supposed to install 6 apps from the urls i fed it,0
it got stuck in an infinite loop,0
guess what happened?,0
@Mr.Pathetic sorry i just arrived could you describe the problem again,0
i want to join string like this,0
"```pyx = [""I am  a bad person""]print( .join(x))```By the way it\'s better to let go of your x don\'t try to join.",1
in this program in x,0
x is not a list in your program,0
yes kranos but what is it is string only with comma,0
you need an iterable to join,0
WHY DO U NEED TO PUT _ IN PRINT,0
Caps off,0
there is no _ in print mate,0
it is that green line,0
idk what it does,0
sqiggly ?,0
Tf,0
yes kronos,0
don't have a space there,0
what are you trying to do to the x ?,0
@sahil04 no im just,0
@sahil04 yes,0
Im conf,0
@sorry about spaces,0
im beginner,0
Np,0
What are you trying to do ? @Mr.Pathetic,0
@Kronos i want to join that string,0
x,0
join in the sense?,0
Rip,0
what is your required output ?,0
without comma it should become one stringg,0
sent x string here,0
addwdwdwdwdwd,0
with the commas,0
this should be oputput,0
sent me the current string which has commas,0
"x = ad,dw,dw,d,w,d,wd,wd",0
"```pyx = ad,dw,dw,d,w,d,wd,wd'x = x.replace(',','')print(x)```",0
Try this,0
...\\,0
ok but cant we do this without join?,0
This is without join,0
"```pyx = ad,dw,dw,d,w,d,wd,wd'x = x.replace(',','')print(x)``` @Mr.Pathetic This is the whole program",0
@Kronos ok kronos,0
this is last question,0
Okay,0
we can only join lists?,0
no any iterable,0
Not just list,0
if you can use a for loop on it you can join it,0
^,0
what is iterable?,0
ok which contain data?,0
like words?,0
yes balaio is correct,0
You are not allowed to use that command here. Please use the #botcommands channel instead.,0
```py .join([1 2 3])```this doesn\'t work,0
bruh,0

os.path.splittext() i think,0
@Urkchar it will work but will be slow than normal sum ig,0
Well spam some 50 digit numbers and try it :py_guido:,0
1e50 100 times,0
Yes python can handle that,0
But the programming way is to use school addition method,0
You need to take those as strings and add them one by one,0
should i use async or sync for api wrapper,0
or async but available sync too,0

oh you have md5 hashes and you want to find the passwords back to use another encryption algorithm ?,0
> yeah you just output the hex@lgneous What ?,0
you're kind of out of luck then it's gonna be real annoying and a dodgy move,0
@Kronos md5 digests are typically outputed as an hexadecimal representation of that large number,0
it's gonna be hard and you might not be able to find it for some of them,0
~~rainbow tables are for common passwords~~i'm dumb,0
It's just that there are a lot of md5 hashes out there that if you type in a hash on google someone already used it and they have the string,1
i have a question should i buy o'rielly monthly subscription,0
what algo does bcrypt use ?,0
it's not actulally reversing,0
it's just that people have stored both the string and the hash together so that you can search through the table,1
Bad in the sense ?,0
Oh. diffrent answers,0
didn't SHA1 get compromised a few months ago,0
how fast is fast ? how the current once are slow?,0
I'm finding links to getting collisions with sha1 from 3 years ago,0
am i going crazy,0
i swear i thought it was like 6 months ago lol,0
the slower it is the the longer user has to wait right?,0
nvm it was in 2017 i just had a discussion with someone about this in the context of bittorrent 6 months ago,1
collisions are an issue when the algorithm's most common use is file integrity,0
such as SHA1 (eg git),0

you have to,0
What is this error ?``` for a in self.filename[0]['Filters']['Links']:TypeError: string indices must be integers```,0
what is it saying I meant,0
self.filename is supposed to be a list,0
which has a dict,0
```[{'STUFF : {'more stuff : ['more more stuff']}}]```,0
this is what it looks like,0
sure wait up,0
if it looks fine try `print(repr(self.filename))`,0
that was my bad,0
i wrote another attribute,0
instead of the one that i actually wanted,0
what problem,0
i would guide them through the basics of recurrence with a simpler example first,0
right but it's more easily understood as a recursive definition,0

a prime example of why ligatures bad,0
lol,0
is `input.lower()` correct?,0
i don't even think they're bad i'm just mad my editor has poor support for them lmao,0

How to get the result from that?,0
res=loop.run_until_complete(async_main())?,0
@nekitdev `RuntimeError: This event loop is already running`,0
@dewi can you simply return from your `@command` function?,0
my tkinter button calls a sync funcion when needs to get the result from an async function,0
@dewi (though sys.exit should work),0
@Theagainmen there's no tool that can tell you that. It has to be part of your design.,0
that async function is OOPS so i cant make that sync so what shud i do? @nekitdev,0
it will be better the second time,0
is recursion worth learning?,0
are you answering my question? @Numerlor,0
i actually found it quite hard to read,0
"@Bast I did```loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()res = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro(),loop)msglis = res.result()[::1]```its stuck forever on thr 3rd line",0
yeah i know and i obviously will learn it but is it good?,0
no its not that coro problem that coro takes less than seconds to finish im sure of it,0
@Yali there are some places where recursion is essential. There are a lot of places where it isn't needed.,0
can you `await` inside a lambda function?,0
ok cool,0
if you can then i can make my whole code async ig,0
https://adityamallah.com/upcomingtechnologymaychangeyourlifeforever/,0
```command=lambda r=x: setcha(r)```this is my tkiner buttonand that setcha shud get the result from an async functionif i can somehow await that setcha then everything will be solved,1
@nekitdev async is confusing. I don't know how to do it right. maybe chill out a little and help them understand? 🙂,1
infuriating?,0
> Do you have a running event loop AND tkinter on ONE thread?@Bast my code start like this and inside that main() i start the tkinter mainloop(),1
ooh,0
@Theagainmen all the code that uses a shared piece of data has to use the same lock,0
@Theagainmen the point of the lock is to protect access to the data,0

fair,0
but that doesn't really help :(I mean like... is there a way to stop python from thinking that you are trying to index a dictionary?,1
Yeah! Don't use it at all 😄,0
lol,0
😂 Fair,0
well you can't index a dictionary so the problem is yours to solve,0
in other words make sure you're trying to perform the right operation on the right thing,0
the way to avoid it is not to index a dictonary,0
That's why it raises the error :o,0
you can use `if isinstance` to check if something is a given kind of object,0
"```pyif isinstance(dict myvar): print(""yeet"")```",0
damn it you beat me to it,0

Why does pylance object to this but not mypy?```pyfrom typing import TypeVar UnionT = TypeVar('T')def addition(args: float) > Union[float int]: return sum(args)a = addition(True 20 20.1)```,1
if you're using RE module then you gotta import that,0
because the type hint PEP says `float` == `Union[float int]` and `bool` is a subtype of `int`,0
so pylance is actually wrong,0
or they just don't care which is more likely,0
#discordbots please,0
"Argument of type Literal[True] cannot be assigned to parameter args of type float in function addition"" Literal[True] is incompatible with float""Pylance""This is what pylance says",1
yea they don't comply with the `float == Union[float int]`,0
I changed it to```pydef addition(args: float) > float: return sum(args)```But it still displays that,0
the issue is the bool,0
not the function,0
.,0
So is pylance correct or mypy,0
both are depending on the pov,0
mypy complies with the PEP that specified type hints,0
Ugh I hate annotations,0
pylance is correct in the sense that booleans as subtypes of int is dumb,0

@Chessmaster i'm not discrediting sets. Everything has their purpose. You seem to want to exult one thing over all others always. That's not the way it works.,1
🤔 they aren't though,0
I really want to know why set are not implmented as balanced binary search tree which maintains the order and in ascending too,1
@mbaruh don't engage.,0
> If two objects share a reference to a single object how do you calculate the memory usage of one of them?@fix error Yeah I understand,1
@Deleted User Because searching for an element in a BST is `log(n)` AFAIK,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan I apologize.,0
well hashmap has a worst case O(n),0
\ueea7 \ueea7 \ueea7,0
@Deleted User On average it's O(1),0
oh no,0
right but if you assume the hash function is robust enough then it's O(1) on average,0
the whole point of having multiple types of objects is because no one of them is universally flexible something that becomes apparent to people once they start writing programs that are more than trivial in their ambitions,1
tf is a set,0
it's very close to a mathematical set,0
"@Deleted User a collection of objects unique to the set: `{1,2,3,4}`",0
ah,0
is it mutable and when would you use it,0
they're basically dicts that are all keys and no values,0
Can you contain lists inside a list?,0
yes,0
it is mutable,0
@atlas_core lists can contain any Python object.,0
@atlas_core yes you can nest lists,0

@AquaCherry If your question gets buried here claim a help channel (see #❔｜howtogethelp). Don't post a long piece of code multiple times.,1
Yeah.,0
@Bast :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```[[...]]```,0
thats a list inside a string inside a list,0
> Sorry @nedbat but reacting to trolls is kinda what I do here 😅@mbaruh I was going to apologize for opening the box again,1
So if I were to remove the quotation marks it would just be a list?,0
a list inside a list,0
multi dimensional array,0
you don't need the first input but you do need to initialize `age` so it's not undefined when you get to the while loop @neoncraxks,1
Huh.,0
yes a nested list is basically how multidimensional arrays work in Python,0
thats a lot of yellow names,0
scary,0
"```[ [1 2 3], [5 6 7], [1 6 8]]```",0
Oooooooooo...,0
Probably gonna optimize my code to use lists instead of super crappy dictionary functioning.,0
```py>>> [[0 for i in range(5)] for i in range(5)][[0 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0]]```,1

don't cheat if that's what you mean,0
"Yeah but doing{""max number"":""3""""1"":""633636""""2"":""74747""""3"":""8463""}is not the best way to do things you might as well just use a list.",0

@kutiekatj9 for having sentences or random Discord messages lists are the better way to go.,0

I think there's a rule against it too?,0
!rule 5,0
,0
If for instance I was hell bent on not using a database and I wanted to log messages by a person I would probably have their ID as a key in the dictionary and then the messages appended to a list as the value. Lists are definitely useful but I usually find myself using a combo of a list and a dictionary,1
use json or mongo or sql,0
databases are more useful for long terms storage,0
plus they are a fun project,0

@neoncraxks to do things repeatedly in an efficient way.,0
I would like to do the same thing more than once,0

instead of doing this: ```pya += 1 a += 1a += 1```we do this:```pyfor i in range(3): a += 1```,0
@neoncraxks you'd be surprised how many people come in knowing nothing about programming and ask such questions.,0
uh instead of doing that do `a += 3`,0
@neoncraxks yes but I only just met you,0
sorry my freind trying to find a use case,0

Not sure.,0
PYthon > all,0
i need to know,0
I think that's one of the main points VSCodium had.,0
my friends keep on saying python is bad c++ is better,0
Python is cool. It's basically C but simplified.,0
@Deleted User they're more advanced developers and that's fine.,0
I genuinely understand why people would prefer C (including C# and C++) over Python and why others would do vice versa.,1
please don\'t say C when you mean C# it hurts,0
bro look,0
@lgneous got it,0
can u not get a job with learning python,0
C# is basically Java not much relation to C/C++,0
like if u dont know c++ u cant get a job only if u know python,0
eh you can but learn c/c++ to make your resume look a little better,0
> @Deleted User what specific tool@Deleted User pybluez,0
C is a lot more advanced and a lot more complex whereas Python is still powerful but a lot more simple and less advanced. Still pretty advanced though.,1
> C is a lot more advanced and a lot more complex whereas Python is still powerful but a lot more simple and less advanced. Still pretty advanced though.@atlas_core C is lowlevel,1
yes and he wont believe that @Aboo Minister,0
well since python is written in C id learn it just to make sure you understand what each line of code is doing,1
you don't need to know C to know Python,0
> @MayActual this is dumb@Akarsh01 how come?,0
nobody will ask you to learn the cpython source code,0
you don't need to I know that,0
you won't get better at python by learning C any more than you would by learning Java or Scheme,0
It's not but it's not a requirement nor is it any better than learning any other language in that regard,0
> @MayActual because you really dont need to learn C at all to use python it is a waste of time tbh@Akarsh01 in some cases yes. I just wound it easier while job hunting if I knew it a lot of jobs I was looking for needed both.,1
Knowing many languages is heavily beneficial to know about different ways to solve problems and to express logic and given how knowledge transfers easily between most languages but that's about it,1

I'm brand new to Python (I mainly work in NodeJS) and creating my first Python library. I see a lot of libraries prefixed with `py`. Is that a convention I should use or not?,1
So I type continue?,0
Pass,0
?__? what is even going on,0
That's better than continue?,0
For example: https://pypi.org/project/pymysensors/0.9.1/,0
Thanks,0
So should I indent the except?,0
Yes that's what I was referring to @LightSpdRunner  thanks! I'll name it without `py`,0
😮 oml,0
@jet thanks that's actually helpful I get it now,0
LOL,0
Answer was yes btw I do so I'll rewrite it,0
there is penis in your code LOL,0
Even tho pass worked,0
And next worked lol,0
right,0
LOL,0
@jet Oh boy... you're very wrong there sir!,0
We belong in hell,0
if you're writing a helper function which is more idiomatic: defining the helper inside the function using it so it's not visible outside or just creating it outside the function as in most other languages,1
@jet There is there 😄,0
Trolling is a very important part of open source coding: the tool is only as good as the community behind it,1

@jet You very welcome sir ❤️,0

Yeah,0
Quick question.is strip() any different from lstrip().rstrip()?,0
@Deleted User yeah,0
Think about what does l and r stands for,0
There we go,0
Yep i know. Strips whitespace from the left and right,0
I thought strip() did both?,0
It does,0
Not the other kinda strip btw XD,0
I mean,0
strip() is no different than calling both lstrip() and rstrip() on a string right?,0
some_string.lstrip().rstrip() for example,0
o_o dang nerds calm down... type one by one LOL,0

Do you have any code?,0
or smth you started working on?,0
Was kind of trying to say that if everyone trolled it would be a burden but if people trolled to highlight that we are all human it would accentuate the open source nature of the creation process of python and the only difference is our discretion / morals @nedbat,1
@dicem0ney trolling is not a good thing. 🙂 You can speak sincerely to someone to highlight that we are all human.,1
Sincerely highlight that we are all humans wearing different masks,0
I agree but the point I was trying to highlight is that some immature people in the community have difficulty conducting themselves @nedbat and while I don't like what they are doing necessarily I believe in helping ppl understand that: and that's kind of open methodology we adopt a consensus habitually,1

This may sound dumb i understand most of the basics including if statements and elifs key logging etc but how to i return on python,1

@Cypheriel at what point does 3.9 need the build tools? what happened?,0
@Cypheriel can you provide more details? Download from where? and when does the error appear? What did you do and what happened?,1
3.9 is fully released,0
@\U000e00aa\U000e00aa\U000e00aa\U000e00aa why are you comparing inp to h. and inp to w?,0
@\U000e00aa\U000e00aa\U000e00aa\U000e00aa but why the comparison? Just use the inputs,0
i use sublime text to start writing in python... but.. no can see result of simple: 1+3=,0
@Cypheriel you're talking a lot about an error that you can't reproduce with no details.,0
@Cypheriel You're probably trying to install a package that is not yet ready for use with 3.9.,0
@Cypheriel ok but why talk about it here? We can't fix it if we can't see it,0
@Cypheriel The best solution to this is to use 3.8 since that most likely has support for the package in question.,1
@Cypheriel again that sounds like you have a dependency for which there isn't yet a binary for 3.9,0
@Cypheriel you have pictures of the error?,0
why not share them with us?,0
You are not allowed to use that command here. Please use the #botcommands channel instead.,0
Hmm,0
@Cypheriel yeah I think you just need to use 3.8 for now,0
What’s ur problem,0
Oh,0
I have such problems with tensorflow so I use python 3.7,0
@Cypheriel the usual reason is with a new version it takes a bit for publishers of some packages to release a precompiled platformspecific binary for the new version if the package in question uses a binary.,1
@Cypheriel make sure you have the latest pip,0

,0
oh okay,0
Who is that,0
3....,0
If statement for what,0
Like if list[2] == list[4]:,0
That would work,0
Yeah that too works,0
@slither code > So a class is just a way to compact ur code by giving it attributes and functionsI would say it's more of a way to associate realworld things or concepts (objects) with an association of behaviors (functions/methods) and traits (attributes) rather than necessarily making things more compact. Purely procedural code with a single function would be often times be able to do effectively the same thing in fewer lines but it would not be great for longterm maintenance readability and would likely result in a lot of replicated code.,1
Aeros,0
We are not trying to overwhelm beginners,0
If I said something like that to a beginner he would faint,0
well it’s hyperbole but still,0
That’s a bit too vague,0
Sure but I think calling it a way to make things compact is likely a bit misleading for anyone just getting into classes and doesn\'t describe why you\'d want to use them.,1
I mean it is,0
You need an ordered list for that,0
I'd also consider classes to still very much be in the beginner domain even if they're not something you necessarily need your first several programs. So going into some detail is likely relevant for most of the audience in here.,1
Oh wait I read wrong,0
So it would be,0
right and even then compacting code is not what classes are for,0
@Eleiber you'd have to iterate the dict. If you need to look up more than one it makes sense to make another dict in the direction you need,1
@✪ SavagePastaMan yep that's why I clarified,0
Not really nedbat,0
@slither code sorry not really what?,0
getting a key from a given value in a dict is O(N),0
You could just use name of the dict[key][index],0
That’s what I am saying,0
@rhuanzinho Please see #❔｜howtogethelp for getting assistance on your problem rather than pasting in the fastmoving general chat. It's easier to get help within the help channel system than here. (Particularly on more involved issues).,1
@slither code i thought he knew the value and had to find the key?,0

~~yeah @sil_ver~~ O(N),0
@sil_ver copying a list is O(N),0
oh `lst1=lst2` isn't copying anything.,0
oh if you do lst1 = lst2 that's constant,0
How can I get started with discord.py...?I have worked on Django BS4 and Selenium before so I know the basics of Python.Are there any prerequisites...?,1
nope,0
because you just make another reference to the list,0
Yep `lst1 = lst2` just adds another variable that refers to the same object,0
@rhuanzinho oi,0

lists and dicts are considered mutable sequences,0
@Cypheriel the only actual difference is mutability,0
,0
@Cypheriel Oh and a tuple is hashable if all of its elements are hashable i.e. you can use tuples as keys in a dict,1
You can mutate tuples with some dirty hacks (at least on CPython) but it can cause undefined behaviour,0

> Hello I’m brand new to python and I’m taking a computer science class I’m stuck on a question right now and am wondering if someone can help me@rileywags check out #❔｜howtogethelp . it's a bit busy in this chat atm,1
any reading for that @fix error ?,0
@Deleted User for what exactly?,0
that a tuple is hashable,0
and which other sequential types are immutable?,0
frozenset,0
@sleepcult You can check if something can be awaited via whether or not it has an `__await__` and you can inspect the current state of specific awaitables based on the type. E.g. coroutines have a viewable state you can check using the `inspect` module to see if they're running suspended initialized etc.,1
Is frozenset a Sequence?,0
not sure 🙂,0
isn't it just an immutable set?,0
`Sequence` is something which has `len` and which you can index into with numbers from `0` to `len1` AFAIK.,0
frozenset would be considered an immutable sequence yes,0
@Deleted User frozenset is an immutable collection,0
"@Deleted User Probably something here:<https://realpython.com/pythondicts/><https://realpython.com/lessons/immutablevshashable/>""Hashable basically means that a value can be used with the `hash()` function and therefore can be stored in `set` `frozenset` and as a key for `dict`.",1
thx ❤️,0
@Deleted User > and which other sequential types are immutable?`range`,0
i think that's fine,0
@Mr. Hemlock It's all defined here: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html>,0
Example:,0
@Mr. Hemlock The terminology of container is perfectly fine to casually substitute collection it\'s just not the term used by the language reference.,1
why _ _l en___ and other abstract methods has this _? what it means? it comes from the local library?,0
If sequence means sequential types (i.e. `collections.abc.Sequence`) then there are only 4 immutable sequences: `tuple` (including derived types like `nametuple`s) `range` `str` and `bytes`.,1
(Although if you seach around in the docs it uses the term container quite often to refer to an object that can store other objects. But it\'s not an officially defined term in the glossary.),1
not necessarily,0
we can guide them,0
!rule 5,0
,0
School assignment assistance is okay as long as they ask generalized questions and not copypasting their assignment,0
@Mr. Hemlock Yep I would definitely recommend using container instead of the official technical term when explaining things as it\'s used commonly in english and makes intuitive sense.,1

@Flash. It\'s certainly subjective but I would think that on average more beginners would be familiar with the term container when used to describe how something like a list works.,1
It\'s one of those cases of it being close enough for casual usage and instructional purposes IMO.,0
all good it's fine to have differing opinions. Hemlock was just checking if it was accurate enough not the all around best term :) (that would be nearly impossible to objectively measure),1
Yeah I tend to do the same assuming it's not in a technical context (such as documentation or anything official),0
Although I find that I'm much more effective at instructing intermediate or late beginners than complete novices as I have a bad habit of making assumptions and thinking of things as intuitive that aren't (probably from staring at too much Python throughout the day and not having any background in education),1

Is the Udemy course for 10 real world python applications worth it ?,0
hi,0
What's ur guys opinion on code academy,0
Oof,0
yeah],0
Ya same,0
I personally remember more stuff on my own ptojects,0
Thing is idk what to make tbh.,0
Oof,0

getcwd() shows the current working directory of my shell,0
@Deleted User Yupp,0
That doesn't help when you run python files from a different directory,0
Like python3 /somewhere/somewhere/somefile.py,0
os.path.dirname(path) < this one returns the directory name of pathname path,0
@k4x1 Bitwise operators are << and >>,0
> os.path.dirname(path) < this one returns the directory name of pathname path@𝕷𝖔𝕮𝖔 That worked! Thanks!,0
@Deleted User Ayyye! you very welcome,0
os.path.dirname(\\__file__) to be exact,0
Awesome 👍,0
When you're dealing with bitwise calculations on integers then you use << and >>,0
@jet Lol I already helped Archie,0
Spooky needs help,0
@k4x1 Can you paste your code in the chat?,0
Lol,0
Lol,0
Yeah,0
@k4x1 I believe you use them whenever you want to find the codes in bits like 0's and 1's,0
the short answer to any question along the lines of Can I do X in Python? is almost always yes it just takes effort,1
> but what does shifting mean@k4x1 @Infinimata You know anything about bitwise wise shifting?,0
You should try that on Python,0
Then go to C# and do it there,0
Once you understand how it works then you can do it in C# too,0

dont use pip to upgrade itself on ubuntu,0
use `apt`,0
`sudo apt install python3pip` should upgrade it,0

In what situations should we use `@staticmethod`?,0
@xtremedevx that's going to depend entirely on what you're trying to do,0
compared to classmethod or?,0
ok,0
where do we use it I meant @hmmm,0
when you want to do `Class.some_method()`,0
@xtremedevx that doesn't seem like much of a performance issue to me,0
for instance factory functions,0
0.01 seconds is ... pretty fast,0
> when you want to do `Class.some_method()`@hmmm We could do that without using staticmethod,0
though,0
well then you could also do `instance.some_factory_method()`,0
and that you dont want that happening,0
u could do that without using staticmethod,0
@Colgate Optic White DM me,0
wdym,0
@xtremedevx the speed of the shell command is not something you can really do anything about.,0
and idk what factory method is,0
@CommitTaxFraud you have to wait until ubuntu upgrades their pip,0
like `dict.fromkeys`,0
@xtremedevx although if you're extracting keys from the registry and doing that by way of a command line operation there's native Python methods that let you read the Registry,1
thats a factory,0
huh?,0
as far as multiprocessing etc. goes those only work inasmuch as there's no single bottleneck outside of them. if you have 8 threads and they all try to read the registry the Windows API for reading the registry is going to end up being a choke point so threads won't help,1
how start?,0
`dict.fromkeys`?is that a method?,0
"```pythonIn [142]: dict.fromkeys(""abcd"",1)Out[142]: {\'a\': 1 \'b\': 1 \'c\': 1 \'d\': 1}```",0
,0
@xtremedevx that's going to be entirely up to the .exe. Nothing you can do in Python is going to affect that,1
ohh wow never knew that existed,0
that's cool,0
or `int.from_bytes`,0
or `bytes.fromhex`,0
python is the easiest language to learn and hardest to master.,0
but where should we use staticmethod inside of a class was my question and what is the difference between decorating a function using staticmethod and a non decorated method,1
@xtremedevx again: multiprocessing will not help you here. If you have a single operation that must complete then any number of threads will not speed it up because they will all have to wait on that single operation before they can do anything else.,1
Is this the python thing?,0
@xtremedevx for the third (fourth?) time no.,0
multiprocessing and threads are not magic wands,0
Is the pic I sent what python thing looks like?,0
@xtremedevx sadly not this one Wish I had a different answer for you,0
@Deleted User what you\'ve launched there is Python\'s REPL (readevaluateprint loop) which is used to execute Python code interactively,0
You just absolutely murdered my brain I am confused,0
🤣,0
@Deleted User are you following any kind of guided instruction / course / book on Python?,0
well I downloaded the link sombody sent me to download python and when it was done I opened the thing I think it downloaded and it came up with this,1
and no,0
I just got and learned about python about 5 mins ago,0
@Deleted User I'm going to recommend you start with something like that. One of the books we recommend in our resources section Byte of Python is very beginner friendly: https://python.swaroopch.com/,1
yeah alr I'll read it but what about the program that launched? is it the right one?,0
cus there are 4 pythons here,0
yes it's the right one. That's one of a couple of ways you interact with it. Most of the time you write programs in files and save them to disk and then use the Python executable to run them,1
,0
the topmost one is the Python interpreter the actual Python in Pythonthe 2nd one is a way to edit and run Python files in a little text editor.the other two are just documentation,1
Ok thank you,0
wait where in the link is the Byte of python is it the Here are what people are saying about the book:,1
https://python.swaroopch.com/,0
it's the same link I got earlier,0
if you\'re not seeing the table of contents on the left there\'s a little = type icon at top left that should reveal it,1
Oh thats the book part ok thanks,0

also i would like to post the link:,0
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html,0
@phoenix yes.,0
one project i recommend is making a madlibs game. to make on eyou need to understand variables input and the basic print function.,1
another project i recommend is a question and answer. this requires input and variables but the occasional f string will be helpful. but since you are a beginner its most likely not gonna come up,1
Make a fun game with oop,0

ok @\\,0
@oak anytime.,0
My friend does not know what the python executor is could I have a download link?,0
@phoenix i would also loop hello world 100 tmes in the terminal.,0
@dopamine D1 okay whats the question?,0
@BarBucks ?,0
I dont know what this is for..?,0
what would i need this for?,0
@phoenix factual statement... hmm...,0
```python>>> my_list = [1 2 3]>>> my_list[::1]```,0
> @phoenix might look into tkinter guis they're not hard and you can do some cool stuff with them. Same for selenium (webbrowser interaction and automation)@Putmynamehere11 i wouldnt say they're advanced.,1

is there any async ui module?,0

@PureFunctor I just want an async function to get executed when a button is pressed,0
O_O Why is your username so depressed sir?,0
Be happy sir,0
<~~> It's not hard either,0
C: Get a gf then I will ask you that same question,0
The moment the conversation discussed about threading/multiprocessing my brain shutdown,0
Potato brain,0
> I mean you could run the GUI and async parts of your code on separate threads and have them communicate with each other@PureFunctor How? if i call the async inside a thread it says `no even loop running in thread` and if i do `asyncio.set_event_loop(asyncio.new_event_loop())` it says`task 15 task pending coro ................... got future attached to a different thread`,1
:thinkmon:,0
What is the rank of a node in a tree ?,0
"@PureFunctor i have a button tk.Button(command=lambda x=r:_thread.start_new_thread(f,(x,))```def f(x): asyncio.run(g())async def g(): await h()```i get `task 15 task pending coro ................... got future attached to a different thread`",1

@Deleted User okay so at the very least I can understand the first error,0
the type of an object is static,0
so `data[key] = value` is basically `data.__setitem__(key value)` right,0
Yeah,0
and that's `def __setitem__(key: Key value: Value)`,0
but you're calling it with a key of type `NewKey` and a value of type `NewValue`,0
so conceptually that part is wrong,0
it doesn't magically change type because you insert a new KV pair,0
that's just a type error,0
Ah,0
and the other errors follow from that I believe,0
How else would you type hint a function that changes a dictionary that way though,0
Using union for even the `data` variable?,0
that's kind of difficult because you're basically saying that there are no bounds on the types of keys and values that can be stored in the mapping,1
which makes it `MutableMapping[Any Any]`,0
Ik this isnt python realted but i cant use my card for digitalocean and i have no idea why ?,0
well you could use `cast` I guess,0
Right everyone says type hinting should be generic,0
which should work,0
Technically I'll only be feeding dict[str str] to data and a string to `key` and another string to `value`,0
I'm not sure how sound it is from a theoretical perspective though,0
> Technically I'll only be feeding dict[str str] to foo and a string to `data` and another string to `value`@Deleted User then why do it that way...?,1
> can someone help me@lilcsz #❔｜howtogethelp,0
Because everyone's been telling me that my type hints need to be generic,0
> Because everyone's been telling me that my type hints need to be generic@Deleted User no that's not right,0
I am using a credit card @Cypheriel,0
So the annotation would be Dict[str str] and str and str?,0
your type hints should be as generic as they need to be and no more,0
e.g. if in this case you are saying that the types of the keys and values are always `str`,0
then `str` they should be,0
So I guess,0
in typing restrictions give power,0
MutableMapping[str str]?,0
yes,0
I'm coming from https://ptb.discord.com/channels/267624335836053506/303906576991780866/764592593404821514,0
but of course that goes back to this,0
> your type hints should be as generic as they need to be and no more@gm do you need to restrict your input type to `dict` or will any mutable mapping work?,1
ah,0
if it's JSON look into `TypedDict`,0
My Json will always be str str,0
Since im using load Ill always get a dict having str str,0
> @gm do you need to restrict your input type to `dict` or will any mutable mapping work?@gm I think what Grote meant was basically this,1
> Since im using load Ill always get a dict having str str@Deleted User not necessarily; it could be a nested JSON right,1
No,0
unless you're saying that based on your understanding of whatever you're loading,0
which is a different point,0
My program stores user input into json,0
using the `json` library?,0
yes,0
"a=int(input())if a % 2 ==0: print(""The given number is even"") and print(a+5)if a % 2 != 0: print(""The given number is odd"") and print(a3)",1
Hey @Deleted User!,0
guys help,0
yeah so when you deserialise it it could have non`str` values,0
Its like a clipboard of sorts,0
if i type for example,0
43,0
But the way the data is stored in the json is from user input,0
Which will always be a string,0
oh okay I get what you mean,0
it will type that the number is odd,0
sure makes sense,0
even if they type 42 it would be a string,0
but wont multiply on 3,0
Which is why i originally started typehinting everything to the specific data type I was working with,0
Not sure how making the Dict[str str] to MutableMapping[str str] helps in my case,0
oh thx,0
lemme check,0

okok,0
Thanks guys have a good one,0
"instead of```pydef foo(): # does X and Y then returns Z ...```do```pydef foo(): does X and Y then returns Z"""""" ...```",1
and don't comment the obvious,0
```py# set x to 14x = 14```no thanks,0
What's the difference between the 1st and 2nd?,0
the first one uses a comment which will then be discarded,0
Why would I use,0
@Viper🦕🚀,0
the second one uses a docstring which is kept in the `.__doc__` attribute of the function,0
and more generally is used by documentation generators makes it support `help(foo)` and a bunch of stuff,0
it's how your IDE displays documentation when you hover over it,0
@Viper🦕🚀 paste your code in the chat,0
o mad,0
i pasted it in my ide,0
so when i use  it wont interfere with my code,0
It's just a regular string,0
thats crazy,0
the first literal in a function if it exists gets assigned to the `__doc__` attribute of the function,0
by using strings we can put doc there,0

I can't put the list outside the functions scope because the value changes in each loop. I can't put the entire code in a `for` loop either that looks ugly.,1

you just need to choose the conda as kernel,0

What is generator comprehension?,0
it's when u use a generator 2 make a list or dictionary or w/e ur datastructure fo choice is on a single line,1
hey guys is there a command to duplicate an item of a list in the list ?,0
You meant list/dictionary comprehension?,0
list comprehension != generator comprehension,0
they are different,0
Umm,0
```python{key: value for key value in iter}```,0
u can do that with any number of items thatre unpacked by an iterator,0
You wrap the looping variable in the int method in generator comprehension?,0
but in the case of dictionaries they only take 2 things a key and a value,0
@pratt If I want to duplicate an element in the list can I just do list.element.copy() ?,0
try it bro,0
also you dont get an element out of a list by doing .,0
you get it's position in it and index that position,0
"```pythonx = [""foo bar""]print(x[0])```",0
i mean u could also use a class :^),0
nah I dont want to copy the whole list I just want an element to duplicate inside the list,0
is it possible ?,0
when you say duplicate are you referring to copying the information of the object in a NEW object,0
or having the same object appear twice,0
well I want a new object but it would be the same like a clone,0
same as in content and not identity,0
do I have to reference the list or only the element ?,0
yea goo,0
next and iter make iteratorsgenerators r special iterators :^),0
well if u only wanna copy the information you could just make a factory function,0
or just use the original class and pass in the other information,0
but with that solution it wont work for every object since an object will most likely have fields and methods unique to that class,1

@Monky it doesn't check another value. You increment y and then you return. there's no other check,0

@Snowballfury everyone on top of the list gets like 300k DMs per second,0
let's not do that on purpose though,0
That does not urge me to dm lol,0
Okay let's get back on topic,0
So what is everyone working on today?,0
Video Editor seems fun,0
oh tkinter,0
such fun much ugly lol,0
i am new is there any tutorial that can help me start?,0
@Sire Moyale Lmao yes have you looked into PyQt?,0
@Sire Moyale Big learning curve but worth it if you want nice UI. They even have a UI builder so you do not have to code all the UI elements looks,1
Yeah tkinter is beginner friendly.,0
My first GUI project was with tkinter.,0
Well first GUI project in Python.,0
My first GUI project ever was in MatLab lol,0
Fun times,0
MatLab is great I used it in Uni a lot,0
Well I was majoring in Aerospace Engineering at the time so it was all I was using.,0
like the flight simulator in awk,0
dude how do you get good at leetcode im struggling on easy questions,0
im thinking of just spending like 3 hours a day solving shit,0
Do someone know a way to convert an image from a folder to url with python?,0
were is the help channel for python,0
this is a discord.js question but if anyone could help me with this that would be cool. I basically have a problem where when I display a user avatar it doesn't animate GIFs... does any1 know how to fix that or what might be going wrong,1
webhooks are fucked rn anyway + I don't think discord will let you use animated pfps without nitro (assuming you mean with webhooks),1
well nah just in embeds,0
it's weird... dyno and other bots work fine,0
but when I do it with my own bot GIFs just stay static,0
anyone know what's wrong here?,0
umm wdym,0
i am using python 3.8.3,0
,0
tired both pip3 and pip,0
i have both 32bit and 64bit maybe that's the issue?,0
C:\\Python39\\Scripts\\pip.exe,0
C:\\Python39\\Scripts\\pip3.exe,0
so i think i need to use 64bit right?,0
how do I get my code to execute something with a probability? Like: for every 1000 input messages received he sends me a message.,1
when i install Visual Studio and then i installed python thing so it auto install py3.9,0
should i uninstall it?,0
studio code,0
sry,0
how do I get my code to execute something with a probability? Like: for every 1000 input messages received he sends me a message.,1
What I shoud use to do it?,0
yea i do,0
i am uninstalling it rn,0
what uninstalling?,0

"what meta character says any symbol in this list [!,@,#,$]",0

Oof,0
from regular expressiosn,0
if you don't explicitly return anythgine you return None by default,0
@Hpmanen Can you show the code?,0
like this,0
does it return the message or print it,0
print I guess,0
@Hpmanen print doesn't prevent a return. can you show your code?,0
how do i write a pattern with metacharcters that says longer than 7 and has at least 2 of these symbols !@#$%^&,1
@oak that won't be easy with regex,0
So I don't use metacharcters?,0
@oak why do you need to find those characters?,0
here is the answr,0
@yardshop A password is harder to break if it has more characters not because it has characters that are hard for a human to remember.,1
I wanna do it myself with a different way of coding and actually understand it,0
`I enjoy writing javascript in unamused sandals` is a much stronger password than `H4ck3r@42##_!`,0
@oak regex isn't good for everything,0
yeah so can you tell me how? I wanted to use metacharcters,0
so can someone help me/,0
oh,0
@Draco please don't ping random people. I have no idea what that error message is. If your question gets buried here claim a help channel (see #❔｜howtogethelp).,1
@TheWorstEspionage not everyone is a native English speaker,0
i mean the funny thing is that was his own message,0
i see 🙂 sorry,0
anyway you would say `if variable_value in array`,0
???,0
@domingofuego by using join(),0
can you give an example of what you ywant @TheWorstEspionage,0
@Brocolimanx I agree. It’s quite strange,0
```pycars = ['audi bmw subaru toyota']for car in cars: if car == bmw': print(car.upper()) else: print(car.title())# in this code I used a for loop and the newly learned if command. This if command is used to seperate something to change it for example all the other cars are title case except for bmw which is uppercase.# Conditional Tests:# Python uses statements like True or False which are called conditional tests. It is used to decide wther the code in an if statement should be executed.car = bmw'car == bmw'car = audi'car == bmw'# Testing for equality is case sensitive in python.car = Audi'car.lower() == audi'```The code thats not working here is the conditional test im getting no output in visual studio code please help,1
you didn't print anything,0
you didn't tell it to output anything so it won't output anything,0
ik how am i supposed to print it,0
"i thought it was print(cars = \'bmw"")",0
or something along thoses lines like justp ut print in front of it but its not working,0
one `=` is for assignment two `==` is for comparison,0
sure,0
yep,0
```pyprint(cars == bmw')print(cars == bmw')print(cars == audi')print(cars == bmw')```,0
ok this is correct right? it worked but it says false for all,0
i thought it was 1 equals then 2 on the 2nd one but its 2 for both?,0
car is the variable,0
cars,0
`car` is still equal to toyota from the loop,0
the list variable,0
i changed it to cars mb,0
i think cars is the correct variable but why is it saying false for all of them?,0
because it's not equal to them,0
```pycars = ['audi bmw subaru toyota']for car in cars: if car == bmw': print(car.upper()) else: print(car.title())# in this code I used a for loop and the newly learned if command.

well probably he meant to have a different variable,0
this is all the code i have btew just for reference,0
what are you trying to compare in the second portion,0
im just trying to learn conditional tests and how they work,0
i still dont get whats wrong with my code rn,0
also your last comment is incorrect `print(var = audi')` will cause an error,0
how,0
,0
this guy told me its correct,0
@Manjiro are you looking for a book? or an actual byte,0
i put TWO equal signs too lol,0
i think public got it wrong lmao,0
i did not,0
so is this supposed to equal 4 falses??,0
pretty sure it equals 2 trues,0
@Manjiro a byte is a value from 0 to 255,0
oh ok so how do i fix it,0
@domingofuego what's up?,0
"!e```pycolor = red""color == green # THIS LINE DOES NOT ASSIGN ANY VALUEprint(color == green"")```",0
@✪ SavagePastaMan :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```False```,0
but there are 4 cars in my liist,0
i don't think that's the issue i think the issue is that you are mistaking comparison with assignment,0
you're learning python 2?,0
well yeah he said it was python 2 lmfao,0
@Brocolimanx i understand so do i have my variable wrong??,0
@Deleted User i suggest you take a help channel #❔｜howtogethelp it's quite busy at the moment,0
im so close to figuring it out,0
@domingofuego python 2 and python 3 aren't that different it will be fine.,0
what's wrong with the code now?,0
@Brocolimanx i just want one of them to say true instead of false like its supposed to,0
i want to compare a list to all of its elements,0
no he probably wants to do `cars = bmw'`,0
@domingofuego range doesn't include the end number.,0
hi so basically all my files corrupted through my linux emulation and i cant even uninstall it.

like im trying to check whether or not this thing is in that list,0
@domingofuego sorry what is the requirement?,0
@domingofuego how would you print 2 to 20 using `range(10)`?,0

@yardshop should i or shouldnt iquit coding is my fricken question now,0
you should not,0
icant use my compiler vs code. and there is not compiler made for chromebook. i cant program,0
@yardshop thats what i was gonna use but people says it sucks,0
what cant repl.it do that every other compiler can do,0
how much would u guys pay for a pill that makes u a coding genius and u can know python and java like the best coder in the world,1
at least 14 dollars,0
@yardshop could i do discord.py development,0
could repl.it do discord.py guiys?,0
i know some people who have done it so yes it is possible,0
thats my main focus so ok,0
time to start using repl.it 😥,0
thanks guys....,0

C:\\Program Files\\Python3632\\python.exe: can't find __main__ module in,0
what happend?,0
@pixel Madlibs,0
@the01crow im using the python crash course book as well let me help u out with that if i could find it,1
@the01crow the correct code is print(2+3),0
no space is necessary after print,0
so after command() never include a space its just not correct xd,0
oi what is it about,0
oh i missed that,0
yea save the file as a .py file before running any code xd,0
i honestly suggest visual studio code its rly nice,0
I had been fighting for days with the python path now came out a main error that was only solved by saving the file and the text editor compiles in python was really frustrated and I see that makes something silly as a sum or show some letters.,1
🙂,0
oh breakpoints yess,0
so basic yet nice,0
even though if u wanted to take a break u could just woop out a post it note and write the line where u left off but its sooo nice,1
yea split() would work i believe,0

@Abu3safeer <https://realpython.com/documentingpythoncode/>,0
@Eric Fischer It means that you're trying to use a local variable you haven't defined. Can you show the code and the error?,1
Is it a good idea to have all your imports at the top of the file?,0
@Toaster Yes it makes it clear what the module depends on. You might want to place imports inside functions to fix a circular import but there's always a better way.,1
Umm,0
@Abu3safeer pick the one you like the most. There's no single standard.,0
"import repattern = r""^(?=.([AZ]){1,})(?=.[!@#$&]{1,})(?=.[09]{1,})(?=.[az]{1,}).{8,100}$""user = input("""")if re.match(pattern user): print(""STRONG PASSWORD"")",0
@nope These are docstring formats.,0
why isn't this working,0

@Abu3safeer I have no idea. Those formats are readable as plain text anyway though.,0
I want to get better at it that's why,0
why isnt regex good ive heard that so many times,0
whats a subsitute for it,0
like?,0
that would use more code then just using simple regex,0
ok,0
Where are you adding spaces?,0
`''` is an empty string not a space,0
` ` is a string containing a single space,0
No I meant that you're not adding spaces anywhere in your code,0
`''` is an empty string not a string with a space,0
well if the exercise if to implement `join` `str.join` won't help 🙂,0
@alejandro Have you already learned about `for` loops?,0
You can replace the `while` loop with a `for` loop,0
and then you won't need the `index`,0
forof?,0
TysM @nope,0
`for i in range(size)` probably,0
@nope #esotericpython 🙂,0
no need for `range` here,0
no need for range??,0
@Pedro. Yes in this case you don't need range  you can just iterate over the elements of `li`,0
oh yeah,0
@alejandro Do you know how to go over the elements of a list with a `for` loop?,0
str += f’{li} ‘ is what id go for,0
@alejandro instead of going through the indices you can go through the elements in a list:```pyfor element in list: # do something with `element````,1
never used numpy,0
uhh,0
without brackets it’ll just print li as “li”,0
not print return,0

@Tetsuko the concept of functional programming might be foreign to you if you came from java or some other object oriented language,1

> Quick question:> How did programming languages come into existence? If we use programming languages to write programs than how did the programming language itself come to be? What’s its origin?@Duck#9474 The physical hardware  the CPU  implements a few basic operations in physical hardware  things like add two numbers subtract two numbers read and write to memory.. etc. This is physical  the chips accept electrical signals (0s and 1s) and produce output signals (0s and 1s). The CPU defines an instruction set such as x86 which is the set of all these known operations that the physical hardware knows how to do. Accompanying the instruction set is the assembly language which is a way to define a set of primitive operations to be executed on the CPU. A compiler (such as gcc) knows how to take a higher level easier to read programming language such as C++ and turn it into assembly code based on the targeted architecture on which the program will run. On top of something like C++ you can implement something like Python  which includes a program that has been compiled into machine code  which can run on the CPU and takes your python script as input as instructions to execute on the CPU.,1

no the break should be in try i guess otherwise,0
> no the break should be in try i guess otherwise@DemonLord no.,0
i will be useless,0
the `else` block is executed only if there is no exception,0
"is this invalid syntax? ```pytry: raise SyntaxError # ignore this just making an exceptionfinally: print(""finally"")```",0
the print never happens,0
it doesn't matter because they're in separate blocks,0
ah yeah @𝕄𝕒𝕜𝕤𝕪𝕞𝕚𝕝𝕚𝕒𝕟 ⟦𝕦𝕥𝕔 𝜟 –𝟜⟧ makes sense what is the point of finally if it just raises an exception? I'm defenitly missing the point of it,1
```py>>>a = oh'>>>for i in range(2): >>>a += h' >>>print(a)>>>ohh>>>ohhh```is there a way to add `'oh'` to the beigining of the string and make the output look like```>>>oohh>>>ooohhh```,1
did u not understand what I was asking,0

@𝕄𝕒𝕜𝕤𝕪𝕞𝕚𝕝𝕚𝕒𝕟 ⟦𝕦𝕥𝕔 𝜟 –𝟜⟧ i got it and sorry for the bad explanation,0
I don't think one case is necessarily more Pythonic than the other,0

I wanna make a api wrapper but should i make it async or sync :GWseremePeepoThink:,0
dude,0
its a dictionary,0
for sync stuff should i use aiohttp or requests,0
but can be runned syncly,0
Do u recommend create another class but for async or add async function for async use,0
@Api Owner yes yu can,0
but compatibly issue,0
Termux + Python,0
PyDroid3/Termux with python package,0
should i create a function for async,0

everytime I think I've become intermediate in python/programming a whole new abyss of knowledge opens up. It's scary,0
Does anyone have a good name for another function name but async,0
i have a sync one called `get_user`,0
``get_user_async``?,0
:/ sounds pretty straightforward but kinda weird,0
Usually you should look for self explainatory names,0
HMMMM THIS IS HARD :joe_maverick:,0
async_get_user hmmm> OK ill learn python but how do I install the library? pip,0
yes,0
ah ok so fetch_user(),0
HMMM,0
> @Deleted User if you use python async def somefunction_name() i think most people will get that it's async@o0o0keem yeah but it overrides the sync function,1
yeah thats why tho,0
or maybe i create a object that have all async version of the sync one :GWseremePeepoThink:,0
im not,0
im literally think what name to choose yesterday until today,0
Here's a question.Is it good practice to create helper functions inside the object itself and make them not accessible or should you create a new file with helper functions and import them on the file with the class in it?,1
well i guess my best bet is `fetch_user` i guess,0
So here```py def __init__(self filename): Innitialize the values for the class  self.filename = filename```I the class has the attribute filename but I get this error ``` File C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\Discord.Bot\\filters\\filtering.py line 171 in blacklist_words await self.add.add_words(None category content) File C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\Discord.Bot\\filters\\filtering.py line 91 in add_words with open(self.filename) as f:AttributeError: \'NoneType\ object has no attribute \'filename\'```,1
does anybody know why might that be?,0
> w+ I think will create it if it doesn't exist@Cypheriel w wukk too,0
> What's your calling code@Cypheriel wdym,0
an instance?,0
"for an empty file use ```pyimport oshome = os.getenv(""HOME"")with open(os.path.join(home .cypkg_lock_{}"") w"") as file: toFile = input("""") if not toFile: file.write("""") else: file.write(toFile)```",1
so when you press enter without typing anything it will create a new empty file,0
a lot,0
Could someone help me out in #helpcarrot,0
"> uh. async is.. fun""@Cypheriel more than threading that\'s for sure",0

```pythonreturn .join([dict[x] for x in dna])```what\'s the logic behind putting dict[x]? and why [dict[x] for x in dna] it has to be inside of brackets?,1

@Deleted User yea thats for Windows.,0
so basically is just how syntax work,0
oh I see it,0
^^,0
yeah I will,0
and dict[x]?,0
for example I have a key named something and I want to retrieve the value of that key I would use dict[something],1
I did it,0
Hahahaha didn't know dict was builtin,0
noted for next time.,0
yeah you can use `dict()` to create an empty dict,0
"```pythondef DNA_strand(dna): dict = { A : T"" T : A"" C : G"" G : C""  }  return .join([dict[x] for x in dna])```this is the code",1

i mean you could have looked at why it was saying that,0
yeah but atom doodoo and didnt let me do that,0
what file formats does discord use?,0
or i havent figured it out yet,0
there is a ton of unknown files,0

Hey guys so I have this simulation I created which creates a list and pass it through some functions and end up with another list of objects that have some attributes I want to analyze. The problem is like each time I run the simulation it creates new objects and new lists etc.. I'd liek to be able to somehow save or freeze the simulation so I can run it analyze the output and then running others analysis on those same outputs it seems a trivial thing to do how can I do that ?,1
send the data to a file,0
oh yeah thats a great idea!,0
most likely yes,0
thanks is there any commands to do it easily ?,0
you should decide what file format you want to use,0
!resources @hugg we have a bunch of resources for you,0

i'm assuming you're trying to call dict.keys right?,0
right you didn't call the method,0
that's a method btw,0
chill dude i can't do 2 things at once,0
dict.keys essentially returns a list of all the keys of the dictionary @BakkarBakkar,0
I think a dict key is also returned on index method?,0
@hmm you're probably talking about the REPL (the black python) and IDLE (the white shell thing). you should write programs in IDLE,1
it's a string,0
list always in [],0

hi,0
in this case you're going to iterate over it so a list comp is unnecessary,0

hmm is there any way to make python code run on linux and mac without install python and all the libaray so just like windows that u can convert py to exe,1
like is there way to convert py into mac package or something,0
PyInstaller converts Python to a standalone package but if you want a Mac package you have to run PyInstaller on a Mac.,1
ooo,0
same with Linux; you have to run it on Linux to generate a package for that. You can't crosscompile,0
so i can't convert on windows?,0

@UltimateChaos change your code to this:```pyimport pandas as pdcol = ['i j k l']data1 = ['a b c d']df = pd.DataFrame(data=[data1] columns=col)print(df)```,1
It needs to be slightly nested like that for it to play nice. I forget the exact reasoning but if you look under the hood it sort of makes sense,1
yeah that'll work too,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx One of my friends had issues with not being able to use pyinstaller for windows as well since he was on linux. Sadly couldn't help either since I'm on Mac,1

@lavagaming1 knowing any programming language is useful because you already have some experience with the discipline needed to learn something and parse docs etc.,1

@koop Also I'd recommend learning by doing. That's usually the best way to sharpen your skills,0

!projects Here are a few ideas on things to make,0
,0
@UltimateChaos If you ever need to pull together a df from disparate sources it's much faster to compile it into a dict first then transform it to a dataframe. With larger datasets it can be magnitudes of order faster,1
Not in the stdlib but there's Pillow,0
@J Δ∇ your question is probably best asked in #datascienceandai,0
also for somereason when i use pyinstaller i have issue with function py file like i made a function in another file but seems like pyinstaller can't able to use it,1
@petr Pillow is a fork of PIL (python image library). Today though Pillow is the recommended one to use. I've used it as well and I quite like it so far,1
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx You're probably missing that file in your packaged project because PyInstaller isn't detecting it automatically.When you first run PyInstaller on a project it generates a .spec file that's in your projects root directory. With that you can customize future runs of PyInstaller to do things like include imports that it doesn't detect properly (in this case requests)https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/specfiles.htmlthat doc goes into how spec files can be generated reused edited etc. They're the key to making PyInstaller work right,1
@lavagaming1 I'd recommend claiming a help channel or asking in the topical channels when you need help. Check out #❔｜howtogethelp for more info,1
ah yes the forbidden operator `one = l`,0
how is this python related,0
I have a relatively large number of global boolean states I want to keep track of (around 100). I was planning to define them in a config.py type file and import them where they're needed. I would like to be able to use hinting so pycharm can work its magic as I write the code and refer to them so something like having them defined as toplevel members would work for that. However I also want to be able to reset them all to False which would be easy if I put them in a dictionary but then I lose my hinting. I could do some hybrid thing with Enums but wanted to ask if there was an easier way to accomplish it.,1
@ketemphor you\'ve probably heard this already but large number of global boolean states seems like a code smell,0
I'm not a native python programmer and this is piggybacking on another framework so I don't have a lot of options for modifying things at the top level. I need to be able to share state but can't modify the framework that calls the code I'm writing so can't add in anything that would pass around extra configuration/state data.,1

@Deleted User Stop spamming your message.,0
that's what I'm looking at in option 2 @yardshop. It just seems like it loses by ability to say config.variablename and have pycharm help me out with hints for the variablename. instead I have to do config.dict.get('variablename') and pycharm will have no way of knowing the members of the dict ... it's just me being lazy after a fashion but the hinting helps a lot when you're referring to dozens of variables,1

@oak You can look into the lookahead `(?=...)` operation. <http://regularexpressions.info/> is a good resource for learning regex but keep in mind that Python's regex flavour may not be compatible with a different one (<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html> for reference).,1

yeah locals() is coming up empty in the little test jig I'm playing with,0
I think the whole point of args and kwargs is that they could be collections of any number of things,0
How to override functions? I read about monkey patching when searching around but I'm not sure if it's the right thing.,1
yeah that could work. I'd like to have a function in there as well that does the reset for me and in that case functions get included in the __dict__ but I can just ignore all members that have a value of anything but True (and then just set those back to False),1

@oak regex characters can change their meaning depending on where they are. Can you show the whole thing?,0
So it's two separate files but the unchanged functions are only defined in the original,0

@Deleted User PyInstaller is the most common way to do it but you need to read its manual carefully and closely,1
any easier ways?,0
I’m about to give up on regex so complicated and,0
Whats the easiest way,0
regex can get out of hand with more complex expressions especially if you're not using the verbose mode where you can use comments and whitespace,1
One way to avoid excessive regex complexity is to create one general case get a capture from that and then use another regex/match object on the capture to narrow it down etc.,1
@Deleted User PyInstaller is about the easiest because Python was never meant to be distributed standalone,0
sheeeeeessh,0
that way instead of fighting against the incremental complexity of regex you can break the problem up into proper subproblems.,0
Both of my big projects right now use a lot of regex,0
so I've accrued some experience in this regard haha,0
for experience substitute agony,0
> One way to avoid excessive regex complexity is to create one general case get a capture from that and then use another regex/match object on the capture to narrow it down etc.Or use regex to split the text into tokens and then parse those tokens: <https://github.com/decoratorfactory/pixijsassembly/blob/master/src/cpu/assembler.js>,1

and `sum` isnt a good variable name anyways,0
its a builtin,0
@Sire Moyale thats an unrelated issue,0
it should be the same tho,0
it doesnt matter if its added to user PATH or system PATH,0
`pyhton`,0
chill print,0
`sum` isnt assigned anything,0
so its just going to be the builtin var,0
ok boys I'm learning python and i want to know is it possible to make an if statement work with an input print? if so can someone provide example?,1
pythons misspelled again,0
So hey... i've been getting an issue that makes me want to cry.```cmddiscord.ext.commands.errors.CommandInvokeError: Command raised an exception: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ./images/zahando.gif'Command raised an exception: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ./images/zahando.gif'```,1
why... is this happening...,0
I started getting it recently but I can't figure out why,0
It was working fine but then after the update this has been happening ALOT,0
then I would restart the bot... and it'd work fine for a while... then vanish again,0
I changed the paths from relative to absolute... and still...,0
heyyyy,0
Yea cause whenever I restart the bot... It works again for a bit...then it...,0

can someone tell me what i did wrong here last thing lol. I tried making an if else statement that determined whether or not something was greater than or less than x = 5 but i think i did it wrong lol,1
Can someone answer my question pls,0
> How would you add all the even numbers between 2 numbers using a while loop?@Jamie_ like seriously modulus operator... you set up your... wait what?Why are you even using a while loop?,1
Why did u convert input twice,0
i tried making it a string just to see what would happen as you see,0
I always just convert when I’m using print,0
while loop is for when you don't know exactly the ending/starting point... if you taking input from a user you can just use a for loop 🤷🏿\u200d♂️,1
> @nullbyteshell You never assigned the input to a variable. You just printed it. And you have some unnecessary type conversions in there.@LightSpdRunner yes i was just experimenting with conversion,1
but ill try assigning,0
Don't worry I have my replacements in my back pocket,0
While was the first one you learnt?????,0
?,0
by putting the input statement in the loop,0
What exactly do you want it to do 10 times?,0
I'm honestly confused as well,0
oh... then change n to 10 like Mike said,0
in the for loop btw... your variable n = int(input etc) is fine,0
Why are you getting a number from the user?,0
Yes,0
Ah I see,0
but it prints 10 times,0
which is what you want,0
You don’t need to specify the 0. That’s assumed if you leave it blank,0
then that would do it 9,0
yea for i in range(10) is fine,0
with?,0

well... everything is an object but... yk what I mean,0
an object containing the data inside of a script,0
sigh... never easy is it...time to hit that help(os.getcwd),0
and you could access functions by this ```pymymodule.myfunction()```,0

Yes.. but as....,0
if you can divide the number by two,0
in fact... i'll just IDLE it,0
add it inside a list,0
ZovokkkkI said you'd use Modulus,0
and return of the values in the list as an integor,0
🤐,0
dw it's a learning process,0
the modulus (%) returns the remainder from a division,0
yeah,0
so5 % 2 will return 1,0
where as 10 % 5 will return 0,0
does any have an idea of a module I should learn?,0

Scratch made me feel like I was in one of those crappy kids games with the blocklooking code.,0
its decent for starting out,0
Scratch is a great language to get started with to understand the concepts of programming,0
yeah the block like code completely turned me away just that one aspect,0
I mean python isn't bad as far as complication.,0
Yep!,0
in the most literal way as possible @Sire Moyale,0
From what I wrote when discussing age group of scratch a while back:> Scratch is more about understanding the flow programming without remembering exact syntax. Doesn’t matter if you’re a kid or an adult. You focus on the important concepts first which helps no matter the age. Still it’s probably best suited for children,1
Even a 3rd grader could understand if/else statements on scratch lol,0
Yep!,0
Yeah,0
yeah my school 18 only taught us scratch lol,0
The best way to learn Python is by putting a Project and working on it and finding solution on Google or Stackoverflow,1
Couldn't imagine them teaching us something like python.,0
Yeah haha,0
Actually my school which was a Preschool through 8th grade all in one building never had a designated coding class. They just told us to get on scratch and do little beginner courses after our other classes.,1
Hmm anyone know how to convert unix time to this img?,0
yes,0
Wait shouldn't you be asking for help in the help channels?,0
oh,0
i am trying to using the steam api but with last online thing it gave me 1602800745 which is in unix time i wanted to be able to convert that into hrs mines secs etc...,1
ok thx,0

umm how is that part of python?,0

I'm not sure I quite understand,0
Why does the channels act werid after a certain period,0
ohh,0
Thanks!,0
Hmm just wonder is that way to make it so that date and time  with current time to get how long ago?,1
i am partty sure that's how this work,0
1 hours,0
so like 1602800745 is the time i got it off then  with current time to get how long i've been offline,1
not really sure how to do that,0
ye,0
so i guess both have to be in unix time right? if i want to  it,0
hi,0
i have a question,0
i started learning python about 4 months ago and i stopped doing it since like 2 months ago anyone know any videos that are python recaps?,1
so what does it do?,0
@yardshop,0
i think there's a fundamental misunderstanding. discord provides an API for people to use. the writers of discord.py just made it very easy to use it,1
its like a recap?,0
i have learn python already i have stopped doing it for a while i want like a recap video to get staerted again,1
a project,0
hmmmm,0
XD 19691231,0
oh i thought it was jan 1 1970,0
that's the epoch,0
so any idea what could i do? XD,0
oh i see what you did yeah that's not the epoch it's a few hours before,0
convert to secs then  it?,0
i dont know much about unix time system D:,0

oof,0
"so how am i able to convert that and  it with current time to get how many hours,mins,secs ago?",0

so ever since i've gotten ubuntu on my laptop my mousepad kept not workng every once in a while today i searched how to fix it while i was having that problem and disabling and enabling it with xinput worked just fine so my idea was to just make a program that did that for me so i didn't have to open the cmd do xinput then disable and enable how can i use xinput in python?,1
@Gioo hash the password,0
i hate math XD,0
no just encrypting it is so unsafe,0
just.. hash the paswords.,0
ah so you need to get the passwords back? @Gioo,0
can u show me how pls?,0
what is this for,0
so this man just asked here for someone to build his whole bot.,0
ok,0
so.. how can i use xinput in python,0
I think i'll try that @marc  it's just ike i had before i pur random,0
@SοmeDude who are you replying to,0
ah,0
so if you want to encrypt it you'll also have to store the key to decrypt it so next question is: how can you make THAT KEY safe?,1
lol,0
so something like:,0
that's.. idk,0
howd you get that discord background,0
...,0
better discord prolly,0
you are a hackerman and you hacked discord,0
anyway so you wouldn't store the password to decrypt the password... anywhere. so if you forget the password to get the pasword you lose the password,1
this is so convoluted,0
don't be rude tho,0
hey public static void main can u give me a hand,0
the idea is that you store a salted hash and whenever someone tries to log in you hash what they enter and check if it's equal to the hash,1
well yeah but that's just an extra step that sovles nothing,0
so you store the password in case yuo forget it but if you need a password to get it back what if you forget that one?,1
you never store raw passwords that's just dumb,0
you might say the one you want to encrypt is huge and long and so you encrypt it with a simpler one but then... you have the same security problem one step down,1
well no,0
@sourlemon also this isn't for me it's for @Gioo,0
i'm also confused,0
how do i get this item?,0
this is my code,0
i think it's a json format,0

but i can't seems able to get steamid item,0
any idea how i can get that data?,0

@『キリト』 Unfortunately modern versions of Python don't support Windows XP anymore.,0
You _really_ need to upgrade.,0
Or you can program online?,0
But why not upgrade to windows 10? do you have a limited computer? or wanna play old games?,0
@『キリト』 Python 3.4.3 supports Windows XP yes. But it's a very outdated version from 2015. If you want to learn Python you can use an online environment like https://repl.it .In the long run of course you will have to upgrade your system. Either buy Windows 10 or try a Linux distribution.,1
well kinda most of European systems like hospitals runs xp,0
It's insecure but will cost a lot to migrate to windows 10,0
~~don't insult vscode like that~~,0
🙂,0
repl.it is very cool indeed it even has a bash terminal where you can access an ubuntu system.,0
Hospitals and buisnesses should just buy their windows 10 keys on ebay or g2a 😃,0
@PAVARASI check your dms,0
you can do it on your own,0
pretty easy to upgrade I doubt your parents would mind.,0
but hey they arent mine lol,0
@『キリト』 check if you have it in the system,0

I don't like video courses. CodeCademy is pretty expensive for learning programming also.,0
You can find better options for free.,0
@『キリト』 did you check if you have it in the system?,0

it was a joke mods pls dont ban 😦,0
@『キリト』 it may or may not be because of this but you seriously need to update your pc lmao,0
Guys pls if you are not talking about python go to a offtopic channel,0
^,0
you're using windows xp you should get at least 7,0
lots of programs dont even support xp anymore wouldnt doubt that python also doesnt support it,0
@『キリト』 Check the compabilities of your system and check if you can upgrade to 10 or 7,0
@PAVARASI to your math question it depends on what kind of lines you are writing. It just takes a little arithmatic.,1
@realp are you using pytest to run the tests?,0
i wouldnt try to fix python if its giving you issues on xp. its likely the fact that its a very old OS,1
@realp it handles displaying the error and running the next test,0
@PAVARASI @Slow you guys need to move to offtopic discussion,0
we already asked,0
@realp you write tests in a file it runs them,0
@Slow you guys arent discussing python though,0
@PAVARASI no,0
@realp but you also don't want to write your own test runner,0

```pythonnumber_user_input = list(input('Introduce the number')) original_input = number_user_inputreversed_input = number_user_inputreversed_input.reverse()print(original_input)print(reversed_input)```Why does this return the same string reversed and not the original and then the reversed? Example.```pythonIntroduce the number 23>>> ['3 2']>>> ['3 2']```,1
@Deleted User because you arent setting the var to the .reverse,0
reverse doesn't return anything,0
```pyreversed_input = reversed_input.reverse()```,0
reversed_input would be equal to None in that case.,0
I convert the input() in a list in the same line as in the process of assignment,0
there may be more issues but if you are using a function that returns a modified value you need to set a variable equal to the function use,1
@PAVARASI quick scripting objects parsing web scraping lots,0
.reverse() changes the original value it doesn't return anything just changes it,0
But don't understand why it does change both variables and not only one.,0
it is a list,0
```pythonnumber_user_input = list(input('Introduce the number')) ```,0

oh thats probably what it meant lol,0
@sourlemon why do you .hex() a hexdigest?,0
@Calme im not a god but i know sql. this is more of a question for #databases though,0
this is all i see tho,0
for getting the friendlist,0
@sourlemon but it's not an int it's hex.,0
@sourlemon never do encryption yourself,0
@sourlemon hmm it's all digits I guess but it's not very well distributed. If you just need an int use the random int.,1
its a horrible idea. its just a generally accepted rule. you are nowhere near as secure as you think you are,1
Why there's another Python Snake :c,0
oh yea that will work,0
unless of course you're just toying with it. but never use that kind of stuff in production,0
accident waiting to happen,0
@sourlemon or use the digest of the hash,0
doublehexing doesn't gain you anything,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx have you looked into the steam api wrappers on pypi? unless you wanna do it yourself,0
oh i just uses the web api,0
@nope wrappers are used to make apis easier to use especially massive scale ones,0
wrappers do not replace apis,0
How do i get all the steamid into a list?,0
the bots in this server likely use discord.py or discord.js which are both wrappers for discord's api,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx do you want the keys or the values into a list?,0
ye i am not doing a big project,0
map? whatyou can just do `result.values()`,0
BOSS has been working on steamids for a while now.,0
i want the steamid in a list,0
that is unnecessarily complex,0
he can just loop through the dict values and append them to a list,0
maybe not but readability is an oof,0
Hmm,0
i dont think that theres a runtime difference between them why not just do the easier to read one,0
idk how to use it ether,0
still dont get it,0
phew long night of note taking see you guys tomorrow :cereal:,0
```pyfriends = results['friendslist']['friends']friend_steams = []for f in friends: friend_steams.append(f['steamid'])```something like that,0
oh,0
you can use map and lambdas but i hate them,0
your choice,0
i have never needed to use a lambda lol,0
yes discord.py,0
you can do that?? i learn more about this language every day,0
is it a new thing or has it been in python like always?,0
@Drīft you are free to ask here but this discord is probably more suited. however this general channel isnt really used for help that takes a while its used for quick questions sometimeshttps://discord.gg/dpy,1
im hoping someone here knows:how can i strip only zalgo characters off a string without stripping off emotes and accent marks and stuff?,1
i asked in a help channel but nobody answered lol,0
i saw old python 2 code for it using the codecs library and such but didnt work,0
that wouldnt work,0
hmm didnt seems to work,0
that only gets rid of spaces or the char you specify,0
id rather rebuild the string using regex,0
it gave me last item with full not just steamid,0
Im starting new on python. Not clear on what (type( does for my code.,0
D:,0
just noticed,0
my adhd can go die in a fire for right now please,0
@Moderation Team try typing @kill'.. theres some uh.. obscene names there,0
sorry for the @  i couldve just mentioned pure didnt know they were active doe,0
i guess that makes sense,0
server is huge after all it just bugged me,0
Hmm how do i convert all the ids i got into username then put it into a list?,0
well you have to edit the loop right now its set to only pull the steamids,0
actually,0
the api returns the name right?,0
if not you can probably use another api to convert steamid to username,0
for x in friend_steams?,0
maybe,0
can i see your code?,0
Umm sure ig let me remove all the keys,0
ok yea the api you're using doesnt include names you will need to use another part of steam api to get the current username,1
then you can store them in a dictionary,0
```pythonfrom datetime import datetimeimport json requestsKey = userinfo = requests.get('http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/?key=%s&steamids=76561198801475801 % Key)userinfo = json.loads(userinfo.text)usersteamid = userinfo['response']['players'][0]['steamid']userpersonaname = userinfo['response']['players'][0]['personaname']usericon = userpersonaname = userinfo['response']['players'][0]['avatarfull']#get user statesdef Onlinestatus(): if userinfo['response']['players'][0]['personastate'] == 0: print('User is offline') if userinfo['response']['players'][0]['personastate'] == 1: print('User is Online') if userinfo['response']['players'][0]['personastate'] == 2: print('User is Busy') if userinfo['response']['players'][0]['personastate'] == 3: print('User is Away') if userinfo['response']['players'][0]['personastate'] == 4: print('User is Snooze') if userinfo['response']['players'][0]['personastate'] == 5: print('User is looking to trade') if userinfo['response']['players'][0]['personastate'] == 6: print('User is looking to play')Onlinestatus()friendlist = requests.get('http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetFriendList/v0001/?key=&steamid=76561198801475801&relationship=friend')friendlist = json.loads(friendlist.text)friends = friendlist['friendslist']['friends']friend_steams = []for f in friends: friend_steams.append(f['steamid'])Totul = len(friend_steams)for x in friend_steams: print(Totul)td = datetime.now()  datetime.fromtimestamp(1602800745) # returns a timedelta#print(str(td))```,1
i dont need all of that just```pyfriendlist = requests.get('http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetFriendList/v0001/?key=&steamid=76561198801475801&relationship=friend')friendlist = json.loads(friendlist.text)friends = friendlist['friendslist']['friends']friend_steams = []for f in friends: friend_steams.append(f['steamid'])```,0
oh,0
so this code is working as intended right?,0
yes,0
yea thats a lot of code lol,0
lemme find the api for username getting unless someone beats me to it,0
it gave all the steam ids but now it needs convert into usernames XD,0
https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetPlayerSummaries_.28v0002.29,0
u mean in the function?,0
oh that's just a test after all the code is done then i need to let it send data via socket xD,1
So correct me if im wrong but the purpose of strings and its extensions is for adding or linking a line of code to another line of code. I'm a bit new so sorry for the obvious seeming question.,1
sorry similar performing syntax 🙂,0
Ok,0
```pyfriendlist = requests.get('http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetFriendList/v0001/?key=&steamid=76561198801475801&relationship=friend')friendlist = json.loads(friendlist.text)friends = friendlist['friendslist']['friends']friend_steams = {}for f in friends: f_name = json.loads(requests.get('api shit here').text)['key if needed'] friend_steams[f_name] = f['steamid']```something like thisyou should incorporate a dictionary into this and utilize the api to get the name,1
yeah I butchered all of it.,0
thanks for the clarification,0
"this code will return stuff like```py{'lance':236626236263,'beastboy':763762376327}```",0
oh i was thinking maybe let it replace the steamid with the id then id +1 so it go to the next id and go on,1
actually? huh i didnt know that,0
i recall getting errors when i tried doing that,0
bare except fo today 😳,0
actually about that. does anyone know how i can like search exceptions in pycharm?,0
like possible exceptions on something,0
so i can properly use try except and not make it bare,0
the defaults i p much know i mean like library stuff though,0
sometimes its not documented very well but pycharm shows it in intellisense. id like to just browse all the possible things intellisense suggests for the exception,1
What's a good place to learn the basics of python of you dont know anything about coding?,0
codecademy is good if you have 40 to spend every month,0
@Deleted User so like this?```pythonfor f in friends: f_name = json.loads(requests.get('http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetFriendList/v0001/?key=%s&steamid=76561198801475801&relationship=friend % Key).text)[Key] friend_steams[f_name] = f['steamid']```,0
DataCamp is a good one for free though,0
it didnt work for me,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx nonononononthat line is for a separate api call,0
Ty cenek,0
np,0
so what do i do?,0
not to replace your last one you still need that. that line will be used for using the steam id to name api,1
wdym,0
i have no idea where that api is,0
Hello everyone,0
I have a spark data frame with 140 million rows and I need to validate if specific columns of these rows have the same value of another spark data frame with over 10 million values.And I'm trying to find out which are the most performatic way to do it.Any hints?,1
```pythonwhile True: user_input = input('Introduce a number: )  try:  int(user_input) except ValueError:  print('You didn\\'t introduce a number.')  exit() user_input = list(user_input)  reverse_user_input = user_input[:] reverse_user_input.reverse() print(''.join(user_input) == .join(reverse_user_input)) if user_input == reverse_user_input: print('The reverse of the original input is equal') else : print('The reverse of the original input is NOT equal')```Hi is there a way of making this code more efficient? I feel like I overwrote code here.,1
oohh,0
wait nvm i dont know,0
is it more efficient?,0
i dont know where the api is sorry. im lookin,0
this is there api page https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetPlayerSummaries_.28v0002.29,0
Thanks @nope for your valuable help I'm going to try to use your methods.,0
Hm the While loop wasn't suposed to be there,0
It was for testing,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx this is more complex than i thought. steam doesnt seem to return the name in any api directly.theres a lib for this https://github.com/xPaw/SteamID.phpi found this as well perhaps you can fiddle with it https://steamid.uk/steamidapi/,1
Hmm,0
,0
like i said maybe http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/?key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&steamids=76561198801475801replace that steamids= the next steam id then find that name then go to next one etc...,1
since i have all the steam id in a list,0
```pythonwhile True: user_input = input('Introduce a number: )  try:  int(user_input) except ValueError:  print('You didn\\'t introduce a number')  exit() reverse_user_input = user_input[::1] print(user_input == reverse_user_input) if user_input == reverse_user_input: print('The original input and its reverse value are equal.') else : print('The original input and its reverse value aren\\'t equal')```What do you think of the code now @nope,1
@nope where'st is that,0
https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetPlayerSummaries_.28v0002.29,0
oh what the fuck? why is google useless,0
,0
i even searched this on the api documentation itself too.. no results,0
XD,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx yea u can just call that api then,0
how do i do that?,0
Why is exit() not a good way of exiting?,0
```pyfriendlist = requests.get('http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetFriendList/v0001/?key=&steamid=76561198801475801&relationship=friend')friendlist = json.loads(friendlist.text)friends = friendlist['friendslist']['friends']friend_steams = {}for f in friends: f_name = json.loads(requests.get('http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&steamids=76561197960435530').text)['personaname'] friend_steams[f_name] = f['steamid']```,0
```pyfor f in friends: f_name = json.loads(requests.get('http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/?key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&steamids=76561198801475801').text)['key if needed'] friend_steams[f_name] = f['steamid']``` that?,0
something like that yea,0
Okey thanks again this piece of code is just for a challenge in a server,0
I'll read that,0
"```pythonTraceback (most recent call last): File C:\\Users\\DamienS\\Desktop\\Covid 19 plugin\\test.py line 34 in <module> f_name = json.loads(requests.get(\'http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/key=%s&steamids=76561197960435530\ % Key).text)[\'personaname\'] File C:\\Users\\DamienS\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python3832\\lib\\json\\__init__.py line 357 in loads return _default_decoder.decode(s) File C:\\Users\\DamienS\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python3832\\lib\\json\\decoder.py line 337 in decode obj end = self.raw_decode(s idx=_w(s 0).end()) File C:\\Users\\DamienS\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python3832\\lib\\json\\decoder.py line 355 in raw_decode raise JSONDecodeError(""Expecting value s err.value) from Nonejson.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)```",1

yea,0
what i posted was a guess you gotta look at what the api is actually returning,0
you can test it in your browser just copypaste the requests url,0
or use postman or whatever but i havent,0
ok maybe not postman idk if its actually used for this,0
Not found XD,0
well you need to put a steam id and your key in,0
```http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&steamids=76561197960435530```,0
ok now it says key error personaname,0
ok it worked but it only gave me 1 instand of 17 other ones,0
code?,0
ohh```pyf_name = json.loads(requests.get('http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/?key=%s&steamids=76561198801475801 % Key).text)['response']['players'][0]['personaname']``` cuz it's always doing the same steamid,0
ah,0
```pythonfor f in friends: f_name = json.loads(requests.get('http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/?key=%s&steamids=76561198801475801 % Key).text)['response']['players'][0]['personaname'] friend_steams[f_name] = f['steamid']```,0
you need to replace the steam id there with the f,0
just f?,0
likehttp://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/?key=%s&steamids=f,0
```pyfor f in friends: f_name = json.loads(requests.get(f'http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/?key=%s&steamids={f['steamid']} % Key).text)['response']['players'][0]['personaname'] friend_steams[f_name] = f['steamid']```,0
I need a second pair of eyes to take a look at this code I can't seem to find the error I missed,1
like that should work,0
"i used f strings,are you familiar with them?",0
This inside while loop runs,0
But the code below it doesn't run,0
nope,0
After it terminates,0
,0
uhhh,0
i knew i fucked up the quote marks one sec,0
wait i got it working,0
Oh shit wrong variable name lmao,0
because u putted 2 f strings,0
no?,0
There we go my tired eyes can't catch typos anymore,0
yeah,0
thanks,0
the first f is the fstring f the second is the iterator,0
but it works??,0
f'http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/?key=%s&steamids={f['steamid']}theres 2 f,0
no bu,0
so then i removed and it seems to work,0
???? how is it working what,0
im getting the dict object using the key f is the dict,0
XD,0
well damn,0
perhaps i just misunderstood the issue,0
too lazy to question :p,0
lol,0
no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
wait is there way to remove all the steam ids? and just leave the names?,0
or replace that id with something else,0
why would you do that lmaoooo you asked for them to be put together thats why we did this,0
XD,0
I am 2 good at python D:,0
you can easily do that though```pyfriend_steams.keys()```will return only names```pyfriend_steams.values()```will return only steamids,0
killer this is why u should've used a wrapper lol,0
easier if you're new to this stuff,0
xD,0
ok,0
no!!! vim!!!!,0
vim good!!!,0
so um i need help as usual but this is really really REALLY big. this is for a school project... help me,1
@Deleted User you should make a help channel if its big,0
but i like python idle lol,0
however we still wont hand out the answers you need to put effort into it,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx trust me IDE's are a treat,0
intellisense autofills your code and stuff its so good,0
i have been doing effort for 3 hours and 25 minutes i have a timer.,0
then post the code you're having issue with in a help channel,0
i have to get off at 4 hours,0
#❔｜howtogethelp dont post it here if its massive,0
@nope but essentially the variable email asks for the emails of both of them and i cnat seem to make it work with separating and by keeping them together and every time i run the program it prints out the password input twice. another problem is it doesnt run the else function at the end of both of them. it runs it for one variable not both. there are more wtfthings then that wron gwith it,1
i cant send the code if you want,0
i've switched to the windows studio code but i dont like that so i uninstalled XD,0
#datascienceandai,0
i think,0
vscode is much more lightweight but i love pycharm,0
i got a question @Deleted User am i able to replace the steamid with something else? like personastate or something like that,1
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx you can get anything from the api that youd like as long as you type the key exactly and are using the correct endpoint,1
also what is endpoint?,0
ok that helps lol,0
well done,0

yes,0

ok,0
yeah,0

why would you use an old distro,0

ubuntu devs a lot of their stuff in python,0
no way your xubuntu doesn't have it,0

it never printed Looping the main loops,0

?,0
how do i fix it?,0
i was thinking i can just make it in a def then let it loop over and over,0
running = True,0
so it always running until i change running to false,0
Umm what is that/,0
i dont,0
for now,0
later i use it for like when the server sending me close data then it set the running to false,0
that's how it work,0
but i need the updateStates to keep looping,0
and same gos while running:,0
maybe define itself then call the function in the while running?,0
not sure if that makes any changes,0
i can show u my whole code if u want,0
ye,0
while running needs to be running all the time,0
so it can recv data,0
and then the updateStates need to be running but it can have sleep(1),0
or something,0
so what should i do?,0
global running?,0
what does it need to be global?,0
ok i was thinking it is already a global var cuz it's on the root,0
,0
ok i made it into a global var but it seems like nothing changed,0
still nothing works now,0
yes,0
then after the call it just loops over and over because inside of function have if running: then it runs all the thing,1
wdym? @FranchuFranchu,0
wait that's really old windows,0
Umm,0
add pass?,0
maybe,0
@Flash. what do u mean?,0
also u can see the keys?,0
ok,0
so why it does not work as what i wanted? @Flash.,0
hmm so how do i fix it?,0
it is even hard for me to read xD,0

@Lightning I'm not 100% sure but there are different languages at different levels and there are somo capacitors that translates de 0 and 1 to codes which you can manipulate to create stuff,1

What happens if there is a question on help channel for a long time and no one actually responds ?,0
That is rude right?,0
hmm why u asking your question was not answered,0
tell,0
So What would actually happen?,0
ask any question if u did not understand,0
If anyone is free please take a look at #helpdonut 🙂,0

create a bootable usb with windows 10 and install it,0
@kobrakai I prefer linux but that's just taste,0
@『キリト』 you can upgrade 7 to 10,0
@Lightning you can install in a usb windows 10 plug it in restart the computer and you will see the windows 10 image and then you install it....,1
@Lightning you can trust me get a pendrive with 8 gigabytes download the tool and install it if you couldn't it's because your computer specs is not compatible but I highly doubt that,1
btw you can use windows 10 freely the only thing disable you will have is the appareance,0
just ask your question and someone will try to answer to you @cute cet,0

that is white,0

ever heard of rgb keyboards and rgb lighting stuff,0

is that some asynchronus socket library?,0
its flask_socketio but with `as`,0
oh lol,0
"_since someone told me `from library import name,name,name` is bad_",0
uuuuuh i mean not really if ur just importing 13 things,0
how about 7 things?,0
just import the library,0
ok,0
so the code should work fine im guessing,0
maybe,0
if you removed the function name after ``as`` then and just decided to do``import <modulename>``,0
you'll have to do ``moduleName.functionName()``,0
to run the function,0
ik,0
my import is like `import flask_socketio as socketio`,0
wats the point of having as there,0
^^,0
yeah ik what it does,0
im just wondering the point of doing it in this case,0
kek,0
Yes,0
isnt it arqade?,0
:hrmmk:,0
isnt there another one too,0
pyglet?,0
maybe use a smaller library like what jack suggested,0
#gamedevelopment too,0
,0
ok so the code __will__ work rite,0
coz i aint getting anything,0
not rlly sure out the function works so i cant say unfortunately,0
i guess its the frontend,0

uhh whats a bubble in python,0
bubblesort?,0
also THANK YOU FOR THAT SITE RANTIC,0
HOLY SHIT,0

bubblesort is a sorting algorithm,0
a very very inefficient one at that,0
> lmao i just started learning this makes zero sense to me :kekw:@gabe. same here,0
,0
> bubblesort is a sorting algorithm@gooo yes i know that and its inefficient that one too but i would still like to know about it i missed a class,1
> i've learned loops classes functions and if and else statements so far@gabe. welp you learnt way more than me i learnt 2 types of loops conditionals printing and idk,1
well bubblesort works by going over each element and comparing it to the next element.,0
im still trying to learn how def works,0
if one is larger than the other it swaps the elements,0
it keeps doing this until the list is sroted,0
it's how you define functions,0
uh could you give an example @gooo ?,0
yo whats that sql site that teaches you it easily,0
its interactive,0
less than and greater than?,0
```pythonnumbers = [5 3 9 1 2 7]for xIndex x in enumerate(numbers): for yIndex y in enumerate(numbers): if x > y: numbers[xIndex] numbers[yIndex] = y x```,1

like what < and > are collectively called? @nananananate,0
they're called logical operators,0
comparison operators,0
they compare two operands,0
yup!,0

they are mathematical operators,0
and or and not are boolean operators,0
not afaik,0

hi,0
you can use the os module to execute a shell command,0
"```pythonimport osos.system(""python path/to/file.py"")```",0
or w/e the command to invoke your interpreter is,0
you get the picture,0
yw!!,0
well,0
that assumes it's in the same directory or you have it in sys.path,0
which is a bit more of a hassle to do imo,0
importing should be done at the top of the script too,0
sooo,0
:hrmmk:,0
you need root privileges i guess?,0
yeah but i dont think you should,0
:uh:,0
i think tkinter has a filedialog thing,0
oh no im not suresorry,0
you can still use tkinter tho for that specific thing tho,0

does someone know how to change the indices of a list in between n? for example:team[n] and n swaps automatically from 1 to 5,1
no not reverse,0
just call their indices by using a range so it calls each indice and prints each value,0
guys for random talks go to off topic channels this is a python channel thx,0
@dhzdhd what do you mean?,0
I'm not sure what is does,0
I want to use each element to print something but doing automatically instead of printing it many times like list[n] and each time u use list it goes n + 1,1
tried but gives a error for n,0
na doesn't work,0
"```pythondays = []team = [""John"",""David"",""Tesla"",""Tom"",""Carl""]for i in range(1,31): days.append(i)for x in range(1,6): team.append(x)worker1 = [z for z in days]def scheduler(): for i in team: team[i]```",1
damn forgot about the i,0
"the 1,31 is the days",0
basically putting in it I could do other thing and take it out the for i in range but it's fine,1
Discord bots cant delete messages older that 14 days?,0
yes,0
That’s a list comprehension,0
!list Here’s an overview of how they work,0
,0
so basically I'm trying to say team[i] will start as 0 in indice it will follow up with a formula and then go back to team[i+1] and so on...,1
@KiLo Can i delete older that 14 days with just a single delete(not bulk),0

does an expect block exsist in python?,0
yeah,0
the correct english version one,0
bruh,0
both are correct,0
lol,0
they look the excat same,0
ok ty all,0
except expect,0
I believe you’re referring to `except`. It’s used to catch an “exception”. The word “expect” is used for expectations (not any python specific thing. That’s just English),1
pexpect does also exsist,0
english weird,0
```try: smthexcept: if fail do smth elseelse: do smth(this isnt fail proof here)finally: cleanup```,0
Could someone explain to me what metaclasses are?,0
Yes. Catching specific exceptions is (almost) always the best way,0
hi,0
@Vestergurkan whyyy Gurkan leader?,0
yws,0
You should know what could happen and not just catch everything,0
yass,0
indicex of a list are int or str?,0
@Inheritance ♦ just doing something fun with the name. Nothing permanent hahah,0
yeah dude,0
"```python# 5 people must work 5 days each weak.days = [range(1,31)]team = [""John"",""David"",""Tesla"",""Tom"",""Carl""]worker1 = [z for z in days]def scheduler(): for y in team: y += 1 print(team[y])print(worker1)print(scheduler())```why I can\'t add 1 to team[y]?",1
lol if u would care explain to explain to me what meata classes are just ping me. I appreciate it,0
` days = [range(1 365)] `This i call is a RANGE LIMITOR,0
but I want to give the option to say team[0] works this days then team[1] works this days....,0
also isn't that adding an int to a string?,0
yes issue,0
haha die trash,0
@Inheritance ♦ A meta class is a bit like a class that defines how another class should behave. You can change what happens when methods are defined and more. One could say that they define the rules that a class (with the meta class as its meta class) will follow. Corey Schafer has a great video on them that I’d recommend watching,1
sure thx for the explanation. Could u give an example,0
and also i would prefer text over vids,0
Me: Mom can you give me a Python Tutorial?Mom: You have a tutorial.Python Tutoial:,0
If you prefer text realpython has tutorial on them. https://realpython.com/pythonmetaclasses/,0

Good Moring GUys,0
look at the link above,0
Ok,0
> @Deleted User I mean that worker(n) and goes by worker1 to 5@Deleted User you'd have to put them in a list and iterate through it,1

What do you call numbers with infinite digits in it,0
Like 1/3,0
Okay,0
no 1 / 3 is not an irrational num. when processing it will take 1 / 3 as `0.3333333333333333` or `0.3333333333333334`,1
@Qwerty so how could i make it work as intended?,0
instead of 0.3333333333333333__,0
iterate through dict and append each key/value pair as new line to string,0
the __ stands for never ending,0
ye,0
:blank:,0
+=,0
why whoy whiuy,0
So the calculations involving this kind of number will involve errors no matter what (precision issues),0
oh i kinda like the second option. thanks ill try,0
I wanna change a scientific number into decimal number but I get this. What should I do?,0
> So the calculations involving this kind of number will involve errors no matter what (precision issues)@Kronos no! as i said it will take 1 / 3 as 0.3333333333333333 or 0.3333333333333334,1
ohh like that yes,0
but unless your calculating size of a cpu gate then you wont have an presiscion issue,0
cuz why would yu need to be that prescise,0

@Aboo Minister Threads are units of work for a program. They let you run tasks side by side when they're suited to being threaded,1
For things where you need to make use of hardware parallelism there's multiprocessing,0
!recourses,0
,0
one common use case for threading (or async) is when you want to download 20 things at once. You spend most of your time waiting on the network I/O to complete so you can use threads (or async) to switch between completing them,1
threads yield to each other as needed so you can't use them for things that are CPU intensive; for that again you'd use multiprocessing which launches multiple copies of the Python interpreter on different hardware threads,1
one common use for threading is for GUIs  you have a thread that handles GUI input and then dispatches the commands to another thread that handles the actual command processing,1
@Theagainmen you can still use threads there's just going to be more context switching between them. It'll take longer to complete the same tasks,1
@Theagainmen no your data should be safe as long as everything you're using is marked as threadsafe.,0
@Theagainmen 5930981,0
@Theagainmen it varies with each run.,0
kinda true,0
me neither lol,0
locks and queues are how you serialize access to data and make it threadsafe,0
unhashable things,0
@XiaoYu keys can only be hashable types,0
where did you put the lock??,0
lol same msg,0
hi,0
hi,0
^^,0
good but pls dont obstruct the flow of the channel. you might wanna grab an ot,0
right but using a lock inside the loop means whatever parallelism is gained by using threads is going to be almost immediately lost by the overhead of the lock.,1
you can just deploy it to every channel,0
What is a lock?,0
idk either,0
```pydef worker(): global x for __ in range(100): with LOCK: for _ in range(10000): x += 1```,0

Locks are used in threading to guarantee that only one thread has access at a time to whatever is locked,0

welp,0
can i ask my question again??,0
even better:```pydef worker(n): global x y = x[n] for _ in range(100000): y += 1 x[n]=y```,0
okok,0
(fewer lookups),0
@Theagainmen generally you just don't want to use threading to contend for resources because it's hard if not outright impossible for Python to know what your exact intentions are when doing so. It's best to either use locks or as I posted in the above example to avoid contending for resources as much as possible.,1

yes because you construct a tuple then unpack it (essentially),0
But why does it throw an error isn't it multiple assignment? Like the fibonacci sequence in an iterator```pythona b = b b + a```,1
Hm,0
So I have to swap it so the input gets read first?,0

What is the difference between an integer and a float?,0
Oh so integers are just whole numbers where floats are fractions?,0
@atlas_core real numbers bruh],0
@Harsha yes 2+2=5,0
😐,0
Anyway I meant numbers that don't have fractions. So floats are numbers with fractions. Got it.,0
Yeah,0
I am confused by the thing I just said.,0
@atlas_core if it has a decimal point its a float if it doesnt its an int,0
Okay that's the difference.,0
Thanks a lot,0
In python we’re lucky to have a single floating point type. In something like C there are many many ones,0
Vs code best?,0
I think like 5 types of numbers inC depending on size,0
VSCodium is better in some ways than VSCode.,0

@chyx unless you're doing it thousands of times in a tight loop the difference in time is going to be statistically insignificant.,1

@chyx don't rely on microbenchmarks for hints on application performance. Build your app and benchmark that,0

@apopathodiaphulatophobia If someone on discord is asking you to help with phishing you can report them to Trust&Safety on https://dis.gd/report,0
real programmer is a meaningless term,0
No. In this one and #discordbots (two of the host active channels) they can often be abused so we don’t have reactions there,1
swallowing an error as that\'s called is bad practice because it doesn\'t tell you anything about what\'s actually wrong or how to fix it.,1
a big part of becoming a better programmer is being able to read errors and take corrective action on your code,1

What is the proper way of stopping a program execution in python,0
Nope,0
I want to stop a program that if not stopped when an error occurs will continue,0
But I don't want to raise an error,0
Yeah I solved it just added the program into the try statement,0
```pythonuser_input = input('Introduce un número: )reverse_user_input = user_input[::1]try:  int(user_input) output = Inversamente equivalente if user_input == reverse_user_input else NO es inversamente equivalente' print(user_input +  ==  + reverse_user_input +'\ + output)except ValueError: print('No introdujiste un número.')```Its in Spanish but with the variable names it shouldn't be difficult to understand is it?,1
you're checking for palindromes?,0
Number palindromes,0
actually in this case he's using it to check if it's an int,0
I convert it to a number so if it raises a ValueError the input isn't a number,0
you should add a comment to explain,0
Good idea,0
Anyone here use PyInstaller?,0
they need to be mathematical integers though,0
at least in this case,0
Yeah the challenge had as requirement to try making it for ONLY numbers,0
Didn't thinked about float numbers but that would be more complex,0
;D,0
@Karnia it's possible but complicated. If you're trying to instantiate objects based on a string it's best to store the objects as values in a dictionary and use the string as a key,1

CLR bytecode,0
and/or C# not sure actually,0
the .NET VM,0
IronPython is just an implementation of the Python runtime in the .NET VM,0
it runs at roughly the same speed as CPython give or take at least last I checked so it's a tradeoff,1
in scenarios where you don't use the C API a lot it surely will yeah,0
Uh does it ?,0
I don't think it has the same kind of aggressive JITting optimizations that PyPy uses,0
the CLR is very performant,0
right but the inherent dynamism of how Python is implemented tends to work against that,0
I'd still be surprised if there was no difference,0
It,0
It's worth benchmarking to see what it does and to compare with PyPy,0
CLR = Common Language Runtime it's a component of the .NET framework https://docs.microsoft.com/enus/dotnet/standard/clr,0
it's just a layer in .NET that makes it easier to write language runtimes,0
No it's just the part that runs the code,0
Just like the python interpreter includes a VM that just interprets bytecode,0
or the JVM in the various JDKs variants for java etc,0
yes @basil,0
that's not what he was asking at all lol,0
python has an array module but primarily lists are used,0
no please don't do it like python,0
`list` is a terrible name,0
Python has lists which are collections of Python objects and arrays which are onedimensional collections of Ccompatible types (int float),0
`list`s are arrays,0
they're analogous to cpp's `std::vector`,0
but `list` is an awful name considering `linked lists` exist,0
you need like python3.5 (?) to have that syntax,0
maybe it was some other version,0
just make sure you are not using python 2 at least,0
```pydef func(abc  def): ...```is valid python,0
it makes `def` a kw only argument,0
there's also `/` in 3.7 (?) to get positional only arguments,0
is `def` allowed to be an argument?,0
uhg no,0
it was an example i didn't think when i typed that :[,0
yeah abc so obv def,0
we're talking in the context of python,0
otherwise pretty much every single string of character is valid something,0
uh what?,0

that's not python 🤔,0

Does anyone here use PyInstaller,0

the one you should generally use is just a for loop,0
means `perm` is an empty iterable,0
keep in mind generators are consumed when you iterate through them,0
so if you do ```pyit = iter(something)xs = [el for el in it]ys = [el for el in it]print(xs ys) # [<whatever is in it>] []```,1

hello,0
@pouletfrit when writing code readability and maintainability is key. Using `math.sqrt` really makes it clear what you’re trying to do while `0.5` seems like an actual exponent. Both are valid but using sqrt is generally way to go,1

hi im new to python and im trying to learn selenium but i was told it was trash so i am wondering im there are any better alternatives?,1
but that doesn't contain what I need,0
Hi I\'m using `FastAPI` for a project  which doesn\'t come with a lot of stuff that say django has. i have sqlalchemy models that have objects like:```Useridnameis_archivedcreated_atupdated_at```how can i ensure that a developer is able to access these objects the correct way each time?e.g. ```session.query(User).filter(User.is_archived==false()).one()```in the above example we retrieve unarchived users a lot... how do i ensure that whenever a developer is fetching users theyre fetching active ones.and when they are updating records the `updated_at` gets updated automatically?,1
Many bots does that,0
So I assume that's legal @Vestergurkan,0
@Slow was wanting to make a gmail generator but other people are telling me selenium is bad,0
> Many bots does that@Sliqxq,0
Hmmm,0
Modifying the webhook URL did nothing,0
> C:\\Users\\me\\Desktop\\testing@TheRandom put double slashes,0
If it's in code,0
i think its because its not running because its not seeing a CC on my account,0
C:\\\\,0
so it cant collect any info to run,0
Why do you need double slashes?,0
Not necessarily. Read the TOS and check the available things on the API. Hopefully they have something available for you,0
Oki👍,0
@boopy I don't know SQLAlchemy so unfortunately can't answer your question; but are you sure about using FastAPI with SQLAlchemy? As far as I know SQLAlchemy doesn't provide an asynchronous interface.,1

What is the best place to get free APIs from?,0
uhhhh API for what,0
Am I allowed to talk about bots here?,0
the standard library i guess,0
No,0
Buying bots,0
the standard lib has tons of free APIs and they're all very good,0
Like online,0
Of course. As long as they aren’t breaking any rules and relate to Python,0
Yeah. Probably,0
@FranchuFranchu the things you just linked are they worth a good read or is it for something else,0
The bot is for ordering things online,0
Ok,0
Would you guys use selenium for that?,0
If you’re just looking for tips on finding a bot to buy off topic would be the place. If you’re looking to get a bot developed we aren’t the place for it,1

are programiz's s tutorials good?,0

hahaa its fine we all learn eventually. one thing i dont like about most youtube tutorials is that they all make it seem like everyone learns at the same pace,1

for all people it doesnt work that like :GWcmeisterPeepoE:,0

@60x This channel is strictly for discussing Python.,0
Now let's get back on topic.,0
.topic,0
`import` is a keyword,0
functions are called using parentheses `(` `)`,0
@Natasha a builtin is an object (a function or something else) that comes with Python. For example `abs` is a builtin function and `int` is a builtin type.,1
@Natasha `import` is not an object it's a syntactic construct just like `if` or `else`.,0
i was wondering i dont have any project rn just strange curiosity lets say you had 10 letters how would u tell python to make every single possible combination of order for those letters?,1
like i would google real example but i have no idea what to even google for,0
but interesting stuff,0
does this stuff even have name? like the concept,0
that sounds like some wizardy spells but aight never heard about that ill read into it,0
> i honestly dont see where I would actually need to define and use a class to code my stuff@JustOscarJ class is good for storing data,1

you'd need to use a function to change it (inside of the class),0
you should do problems,0
not projects,0
because with projects you'd do what you want and if your only going to do what your capable of,0
with training websites you'd need to push yourself,0
if you keep doing stuff you ready know you wont learn more,0
> poseidon big project one you could never do right now not one that you know how to do@JustOscarJ most people who do big projects do what they ready know,1
@kendalk08 i kinda dont know what a subclass is atm. i am trying to perfect my understanding of class by doing this projects so whats a subclass and how do i use it? and if you want i can just look it up on good :GWcmeisterPeepoE:,1
learning inbewteen a project isn't that good you should train for atleast 2 weeks then move to a big project,0

> when I say big project I mean do something you have like zero idea how to do so you need to learn new skills@JustOscarJ yes but when making a project while learning new skills wouldn\'t be good becayse once you\'ve learned a little bit of that skill you wouldn\'t go back to learn more you would just continue with your project with out learning the proper way or learning it fulfully,1
@kendalk08 its exceptional :GWcmeisterPeepoEZ:,0
it's better to learn things fulfuly because you will know the proper way to do it,0
instead of copying a tutorial on a specific subject that has no detailed explanation,0
Sadly I learned the hard way,0
Yeah,0

should,0
yes,0
> when I say big project I mean do something you have like zero idea how to do so you need to learn new skills@JustOscarJ,1

it creates a small function,0
i don't use it that much,0
does it optimize too?,0

@Joyte also it's unsafe to use exec in your program (unless it is used by 1 person),0
@JustOscarJ what are you using python in??,0
> which is best@Deleted User if you’re making a discord bot maybe discord.py. If you’re making a simple 2d game maybe arcade or pygame. If you’re making a heavy backend maybe Django. There isn’t a single answer. Rather it depends on what you’re making and what needs you have,1
@𝕄𝕒𝕜𝕤𝕪𝕞𝕚𝕝𝕚𝕒𝕟 ⟦𝕦𝕥𝕔 𝜟 –𝟜⟧ understood it's my first time setting up a DO app. no sure what to do about my requirements.txt file does DO PaaS automatically find it like Heroku does?,1
@Vestergurkan ok is discord.py profit,0
It’s an open source project. You can check it out on GitHub,0
@Vestergurkan and do i need to create website for that bot or no???,0
No. You don’t need to create a website to have a bot,0

@𝕄𝕒𝕜𝕤𝕪𝕞𝕚𝕝𝕚𝕒𝕟 ⟦𝕦𝕥𝕔 𝜟 –𝟜⟧ I think they do have a free tier for droplets not sure about their new service,0

Hmm,0
pythonvlc's media player has a window that shows up and the x button doesn't work. It makes it kind of useless because I have to add the way to close it in my gui and doesn't look good. Another way i could do it is if i made the window appear without a header thing but I couldn't find anything in the docs on how to do that. Also other people have had this problem online and i haven't seen an answer on how to fix it. Im open to other suggestions on how i should do it also just idk why it's like this.,1

@massiker do you have any code yet?,0
@DancingElbow you need a list of bricks not separate variables,0
@massiker you start newlist as a pair of numbers but you don't make a new pair when you find a gap,1
,0
,0
@DancingElbow isn't the rest of your code really repetitive also do deal with all the bricks?,0
@DancingElbow definitely learn about lists,0
@Officer Earl newegg doesn't allow automation in its ToS as Bats said; so we won't help you with that,0
young guy,0
truee,0
hai,0
fun,0
@massiker you start by taking the first two. maybe when you find a gap you can take the two after that? Though you should test on data that doesn't start with two adjacent numbers,1

@cawlyn are you using Python 2?,0

@cawlyn ok what version of python there?,0
@xedre i don't think IDLE is designed to have pluginlike extensions.,0
@cawlyn `import sys; print(sys.version)`,0
Hey @xedre!,0
@DancingElbow why do you want two of the same function?,0
@sourlemon yes,0
What about it?,0
It takes practice. Don’t be discouraged,0
do you guys know how i could create a update system ?,0
i need help,0
something is making my code not loop,0
can someone help me in a chat,0
> @Deleted User include update functionality in clienthow do i do that lel (sorry im new to python),0
imma post in,0
Hey @Deleted User!,0
@sourlemon some things to consider are the variable names used. Right now you’re using names that only make sense to the current you and don’t have any doc strings to help explain the function further,1
@DancingElbow do you mean call a function from within a function? Or defining within?,0
@DancingElbow both are possible but nested definitions are really rare,0
@Panorama2 there's no way for us to know without seeing the code.,0
@Aguccim O(N2),0
@Aguccim because you have a loop within a loop. both go to N so it's N2,0
Not comments. I mean using better variable names and including (possibly simple) doc strings. Something like `user_id` is much better than `usrid` since it makes it clear what you mean. You’ll get really far with this alone,1
Speaking of inline comments they should be used sparingly. Do you know about pep 8?,0
👀,0
Hmm?,0
@JustOscarJ what are you doing differently than pep8?,0
This is a little puzzle for you all.```cssMessage: LPo2nYgULRi8vvePT1o5U0naixxKey: ::2```Tell me what do you think is the secret message with a || spoiler message||,1
@JustOscarJ i'm curious where you disagree with pep8,0
@DancingElbow there's no point talking about an error we can't see in code we can't see.,0
Great job,0
👍,0
Hey @Aguccim!,0
@Aguccim also O(N2),0
If you’re contributing to the pydis repos you won’t be allowed to merge your PRs if they aren’t listed properly. Some may call this going overboard with the PEP 8 but I think having some sort of consistency is key,1
@DancingElbow put your code in a pastebin and give us a link,0
Those variable names look much better yeah,0
let a program do it for you :fingerguns:,0
@JustOscarJ it makes a difference when you want to collaborate,0
yes... many things in PEP8 are important,0
are they opinionated ? yes but we have to pick something so to not let programmers engage in their favourite activity: argue about useless stuff,1
those aren't pep8 issues. that's a linter,0
Not being good at writing PEP8 Compliant code isn’t a reason to dismiss it. It’s a learning opportunity,0
@JustOscarJ i'm curious about an example of an expression that can be simplified,0
are there any AutoHotKey like modules for python?,0
,0
@nedbat it’s like item == None hs item is None,0

@Aguccim do you know how to analyze code for complexity?,0
hello,0
There are two ways of viewing issues:1. Letting go of your ego investigating the claims openly and not being afraid to be wrong and learn2. Not listening to feedback and dismissing it with “the feedback is bad” or “it doesn’t actually matter.”I’m not trying to “accuse” anyone of anything but it’s often a good idea to have a look in the mirror and see how your mindset is. I’ve definitely had times where I don’t have a growth mindset but that’s the exact case where I needed to have a look in the mirror. It’s a lot about letting go of your own ego and realising that it’s okay to be wrong.,1

can someone help me in help_sulfur,0
im stuck and nobody os helping me rn,0
@LightSpdRunner yep. And I don’t think it’s only even a discord thing. We all often get stuck in our own egos and trying to prove ourselves that we loose track of the greater picture. There are almost always people who know things better and you will be wrong. It’s just a matter of coming to terms with that. Maybe even more of a life lesson than a programming lesson even though the concepts apply,1
Yeah that’s probably a reasonable thing to assume,0

@Aguccim i did a PyCon talk about it: https://nedbatchelder.com/text/bigo.html,0
@JustOscarJ that's the math notation: O(N2),0

it is order,0
Hey @Aguccim!,0
@Aguccim again that is O(N2),0

you don't want to download anything from the store to be fair,0
@Deleted User The error says that you're trying to index a string with a string. Apparently `text` is already a string.,1
@Aguccim that is O(N) yes,0
@Logan Gaming you can use VS Code entirely without Python but you need Python installed to use Python :D,0
text is the response from the api @LightSpdRunner,0
@Logan Gaming There's a new major release yearly and minor releases are advertised on python.org about every 34 months,0

Hey @Brabox!,0
@Brabox what is it doing wrong?,0

@JustOscarJ don't you know when you write the code that you've made an object?,0
maybe I don't understand.,0
@JustOscarJ well your code makes the object. what do you mean the user makes it?,0
you don't need exec i think,0
or tell us why you need exec,0
what does your program do? Why does the user care about the name of a variable?,0
@JustOscarJ I see. It will be better to use a dict to hold the accounts. the key is the acct name.,1
classes are fine. use a dict to hold the objects you make,0
,0
hi,0
`exit` is meant to be used only in interactive mode,0
you can do something like string.lower() and then compare... but onlie string == bla is char for char,0
@JustOscarJ you can't. You avoid exec.,0
wait why do you need exec?,0
what happened to the dict?,0
ok so make an object and store it under the key the user gives you,0
@JustOscarJ you are just complicating things. use a dict.,0

There was a method and I can't remember its name. I think its builtin and its functionality is for having padding when printing. Starts with l (L).Someone has an idea of the name of that method?,1
@fix error seems legit!,0
`ljust` @Deleted User ?,0
I'll search for ljust but I think it isn't that one,0
`ljust` pads at most (n  len(s)) character to the left of the string,0
I don't remember the args that it takes I'm sure it takes a number.If you use it in an array of array each element of each array will be separated by X distance and that X distance is thanks to that method,1
```python>>>a b caa bb cc```,0
The best way is to just let it finish by itself,0
No,0

you can also do that with numpy,0

@mindsek you didn't initialize j1 variable but tried to add 1 to it first,0

You probably want to move j1 and j2 into point function whatever it does,0

Use while loop in it take input from console and determine what player wins the point. If certain number of points is reached  break the while loop and display winner etc,1

hello what is the name of this kind of list?```[(2 2) (3 1) (5 1)]```,0
i don t think it s a touple tho.,0
And how can I append something like this?,0
I’d call it a list of tuples. It’s a normal list which values are simply tuples,0
oh it makes sense,0
so I save into tuple first and then append,0
!e ```pyfoo = [(1 2) (3 4)]print(foo)foo.append((5 6))print(foo)```,0
@Vestergurkan :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```001 | [(1 2) (3 4)]002 | [(1 2) (3 4) (5 6)]```,1
You see? It’s as simple as usual to append it,0
"so if i write something like this:```pythonfirstvar = 1secondvar = 2list = []list.append((firstvar,secondvar))```",0
it will look like your list?,0
Let’s try it out,0
"!e ```pythonfirstvar = 1secondvar = 2list = []list.append((firstvar,secondvar))print(list)```",0
@Vestergurkan :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```[(1 2)]```,0
oh so it works,0
It sure does,0
thank you,0
at least my programming instinct works somehow.,0
Often times you’ll find the right answer by simply experimenting with it,0
> append allows only one value at a time@dhzdhd well that s why i put a second branch of (),0
if you look again,0
@OpalMist lol,0
so i guess that s why,0
> Often times you’ll find the right answer by simply experimenting with it@Vestergurkan good to know mate,0
Also I have to mention that `list` isn’t a good variable name. We already have a builtin in python called `list` so creating a veritable called `list` will overwrite this,1

Yea,0
j must be predefined,0

`j` refers to an imaginary number I believe. `a + bj` is a complex number,0
Just like `i` is used in maths,0

Complex numbers allow us to do things like the square root of negative numbers,0

:lemon_pika:,0
They basically extended the numbers line into a 2D plane,0

it means that if you want to learn about complex numbers watch the video,0
They're not real,0
They are very much real but not real,0
They're dumb,0
It's just a bunch of mathematicians memeing,0
Like when they accidentally invented topology by denying Euclids 5th axiom,0
You literally can't do some fluid dynamics without complex numbers.,0
Yeah you can't do a lot of QM either,0
They're still dumb though,0
Let\'s just pretend it makes sense isn\'t a good reason sorry not sorry,0
If you just discard complex numbers because they don’t fit your current world view it’s a lot like negative numbers and 0 were discarded in the past. Complex numbers are very real (but not real) and if you think they’re dumb it simply shows your lack of knowledge about them.,1
Bro I studied complex analysis for 3 years,0
I know plenty about them,0
Then you should know better,0
I do and they're dumb,0
Just because they happen to make real world models work well doesn't make them not dumb,0
I'm sorry you weren't able to properly understand comlex numbers,0
What does understanding their historical discovery have to do with understanding the mathematics of them,0
It's the same conversation as topology or infinite sets,0

hi,0
i never knew why i have been banned for two times from this discord,0
pretty sure a reason is associated with a ban,0
@FAITH if you have any questions about the bans feel free to DM @Python Discord ModMail about it,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] The most common reasons why PyInstaller packaged apps don't work is because some thirdparty dependency wasn't automatically packaged with it.When you first run PyInstaller on a project it generates a .spec file that's in your projects root directory. With that you can customize future runs of PyInstaller to do things like include imports that it doesn't detect properly.https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/specfiles.htmlThat doc goes into how spec files can be generated reused edited etc. They're the key to making PyInstaller work right.,1
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] Every application is its own case. One other thing I'd recommend is using PyInstaller without the `onefile` option because otherwise it makes debugging difficult until you get everything running.It also helps to compile apps with the console enabled and to run the resulting .exe from the command line so you can see any error output printed to the console.,1
@𝔹𝕒𝕕𝕞𝕒𝕤𝕙 it's the best way to have access to the indices of a list as you're iterating,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] are you going to read what I write and try to make use of it or just complain?,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] it doesn\'t work is not enough information. Do you get an error message? Have you tried runnig the .exe from a console like I recommended and seeing what kind of error is produced?,1
,0
@<fsociety>[Joyeux Noël] Follow the notes I posted. Try recompiling the app with the console option enabled and running the program from the console so any errors are printed to it.,1
Don't doubleclick on the .exe; run it from `cmd`,0

@Slow I have projects I work on. Those are my challenges :D,0
> what does it means if \\__name\\_\\_ == \\__main__':@亗__T4t3x__ it runs code that is/are contained in classes basically,0
use `open()`,0
and then `.read()`,0
if youre trying to get the contents,0
so like```pyfile = open('path of file')file_contents = file.read()```,0

you must install numpy,0
`pip install numpy`,0
why not just pop or remove or del,0
`pip install Pillow`,0
that's not valid pip usage,0
yo,0
whats a webhook secret? is it the id?,0
Yes PIL is actively maintained,0
Pillow isn't,0
But you still install PIL using `pip install Pillow`,0
No it's not the other way around ...,0
Oh wait you're right,0

It's a way to work with databases without having to write raw SQL,0
which can be errorprone and difficult to manage,0
if you're working with a program that works with a lot of data yes.,0
both my current big projects use ORMs because they're heavily database backed,0
@Ignatius typically you use a web framework like Flask or Django.,0
a good grasp of Python basics for one,0
and also good practices around managing projects and being able to do research on how to use frameworks,0
because if you have those things then any project becomes easier,0
@Ignatius selftaught. I had projects I wanted to make so I used those as my teaching projects,0
learn techniques for learning rather than specific technologies I'd say.,0
learn how to parse and read docs learn how to set up and manage project repositories,0
how can i make a python (pygame) executable by using mac?,0
@pj mask you'd need to run PyInstaller on the mac to build a standalone executable. You can't do it from Windows or Linux,1
ok so i made the py files executable but if i run them the files won't work together,0

idk im confused,0
@imkuro02 ask in #networking,0
"`print(','.join(list))`",0
also don't name variables `list`. `list` is a builtin name,0
not keywords. Builtins you can replace as there are scenarios where that's useful,0
for learning python is it better to watch vids or just start experementing I already know the basics,0
e.g. you can replace `print` (although generally there's a better solution to whatever problem you're trying to solve by doing so),1

Recursion calls the function right?,0
I'm talking about returning the reference to itself,0

@DarkSnake like I said earlier please provide me the code you are using or I can't really explain anything to you,1
@sahil04 That's decorators,0
@DarkSnake I just tried to reproduce what you're talking about in my code and it doesn't happen. Where are you seeing this?,1
I guess its the same as a list containing a refernce to itself?,0
> You can't reference values in python like that afaik@sahil04 you can,0
@DarkSnake you need to post some code that shows this effect. Otherwise we're shooting in the dark.,0
```pya = [1 2 3 4]a.insert(2 a)```,0
```py [1 2 [...] 3 4]```,0
It references the same list in memory,0

@DarkSnake I know it might seem arbitrary to you but you really need to just give us the code you're running,1
Hey guys quick question how do I extract attributes from a class? Like only specific ones that I need not all of them,1
"@DarkSnake because you\'re reassigning the name `food` to the string `""pickles""`.",0
> Can you iterable through it forever?@sahil04 no,0
You would get a recursion error,0
@DarkSnake this is a fundamental behavior in Python. If you assign something to a name and then assign something else to it the name points to the new assignment. That's it,1
can anyone help me get started on python,0
Anyone wanna help me with class attributes? Just need to know how to extract only certain attributes,0
,0
uh in that circumstance it'd print `pickles`,0
it cant be cucumbers,0
unless u switch them,0
when you reassign the variable it's reassigned,0
you can\'t assign X to dog and then X to cat and have it print dog,0
what is the end goal you have?,0
there's probably another method to achieve what you want,0
huh?,0
"```pythonx = pickles""x = cucumbers""print(x)````output: cucumbers`",0
you're reassigning x when you do `x = whatever'`,0
i don't know what you mean DarkSnake.,0
If you want to set food = pickles then food = cucumbers and then print(food) and u want it to print pickles u can't do it unless u make it an array and set it equal to a different instance (idk if this is the right word in this context) of that array,1
yes that's how assignment works,0
"```pythonfood[0] = cucumbers""food[1] = pickles""print(food[0])```",0
"the only way `food` could print `cucumbers` is if you did:```pythonfood = cucumbers""print(food)food = pickles""print(food)```",0
as LEST says you could use a list to assign multiple items to a variable and then access them with an index.,1
yeah index is a better word for it,0
ah cool i just didn't understand what you meant,0
you might want to look up how to use lists,0
there's a lot of ways to manipulate them and add and remove data,0
anyway can someone pls help me I just literally need to figure out this one thing. I want to extract some attributes from a class object but not all of them just certain ones,1
```pythonfood = ['cucumbers pickles']print(food)#output ['cucumbers pickles']food = []food.append('cucumbers')food.append('pickles')print(food)#output ['cucumbers pickles']for item in food: print(item)#output:# cucumbers# pickles```@DarkSnake as a few examples of lists. but do go look up a tutorial on them or something.,1

Guys what happens if I import a module say numpy when I:1 Import it in the __main__ module/the script I run.2 then inside of some module I import after import it in my called script I import it again.

@petr speed doesn't matter in that case,0
@petr Using a generator instead of a list is more specifically about the benefit of using less overhead since the list will keep track of all of the items whereas the generator will only be able to access the next entry,1
yeah,0
@JustOscarJ can you show the code?,0
btw d? means 0 or 1 d\'s,0
You might have some performance benefit from not having to build a massive list (for an especially large number of elements) but in most cases iterating over a generator vs a list in going to be roughly the same in terms of speed.,1
@JustOscarJ try escaping the question mark,0
can someone sya why this isn't producing anything,0
"@Wxlfy it looks like you’re using `""turtle""` where you should be using the actual turtle module. At the top of the file you’ll have to import turtle (`import turtle`). Then just write `turtle` without the quotes where you currently have it in quotes",1

> @oak tell us about your while loop: why that condition?@nedbat so it only prints odd,0
@oak also your loop doesn't modify userInput so something is amiss,0
@oak use multiple full sentences: only prints odd what?,0
odd integers,0
It’s (probably) a matter of the type used. Things within quotes are known as strings and they are simply text. There are other objects as well like floats and class instances,1
@oak do you see what i mean about how the while loop doesn't change the condition?,0
My lab teacher can actually fuck off,0
Sorry but I am so pissed,0
she returned my work that I spent so long on,0
@petr The way to think about it generally is this: if you are dealing with a decent sized set of elements and don't think you'll have a need to access them again (or out of order) after iterating over it it often make senses to use a generator since it will use less memory. If you need to keep track of the items and will likely have to iterate over it repeatedly access items at a certain index or it's small enough that it doesn't matter you wouldn't typically use a generator.,1
@oak what does that have to do with this program we are looking at?,0
Becuase it happened when I was doing the program,0
@oak Just take a few minutes without thinking about it and then review the feedback if you got any. How long you spend on something doesn’t guarantee the quality of it. Let’s talk about python here though,1
ok so nothing 🙂,0
ok,0
@petr Keep in mind though that those are just rough guidelines and doesn't cover every scenario but that should be enough to get you started with using them for common cases.,1
does pyautogui work without a monitor? like i wanted to make the program clicks but i wanted to let the rpi run but itself without any monitor does it work or no,1
@Darth_Burrito Did you check off the box in the installer to add it to your PATH?,0
@Darth_Burrito On Windows I also generally advise installing it from the windows store instead of python.org which should work from CMD using `py` without having to do anything additional.,1
I'd just go with the windows store installer then. It's typically easier.,0
@ORing why do you ask where it was created?,0
@Darth_Burrito How did you download and install it before?,0
Hey @\u1cbc\u1cbc!,0
@ORing i think it was probably developed in the US but it's hard to know from wikipedia,0
@\u1cbc\u1cbc `start()` will only be called after your close your GUI,0
Wait so you do have access to python from the command line then via `py`. What exactly is the problem?,0
`.mainloop()` is a blocking function so it won't let any code after it run until the GUI is closed and the Tk() instance is done,1
`py` stopped working?,0
You want to call the `start()` function before you call `root.mainloop()`,0
Seems like either you or something else must have mangled your system PATH. But yeah I would completely uninstall python and then reinstall with windows store version.,1
Then just reinstall the packages as needed within a virtual environment specific to the project that's a better practice anyways to avoid namespace issues or conflicts with modules that other programs rely on.,1
@\u1cbc\u1cbc you're using `.grid()` and `.pack()` on the same root window. Tkinter doesn't allow that. You'll have to pick one to use and stick with it,1
> What is a nested type? In Python asw as programming in general@jet where do you see the term?,0
@jet Could you elaborate on the context? It could be related to nested classes (class within a class) nested functions or something else entirely,1
Maybe you mean generic type'?,0
Like `List[T]`,0
@\u1cbc\u1cbc with pack or grid?,0
@My b DeThrone count how?,0
sure,0
@L (UwU) rker they do nothing when you run your code,0
@\u1cbc\u1cbc So center text in label assuming the label is centered within the grid you would add to the label call `anchor=tk.CENTER`So lbl1 = tk.Label(<stuff n things> anchor=tk.CENTER),1
Another question please... I have some basic understanding of how things run when we\'re talking about something like C++/C# (compiled/JITted). Python is a bit confusing to me though because it\'s interpreted and dynamic.So suppose I have a function declaration inside my python script. As I run the script what exactly does the interpreter do with the declaration? I\'m under the impression that it:1 Adds the name of the function to the appropriate namespace together with the line/adress of the function declaration or something?2 Creates some sort of symbol table (for args and local variables) by just going through the body of the function.But where do these exist? In the runtime/interpreter?Then what happens if I actually call the function in some place? I mean if the language is really dynamic I\'d guess that at this point it just does the appropriate stack type operations (save the address/current line of execution save the current local/arg pointers etc. and then set the args/local pointers accordingly ) then it goes through the function declaration line by line and runs the various statements using the appropriate values based on the symbol table? Or does the whole function body actually get saved in memory once it has been gone through by the interpreter?,1
@pk python is compiled to bytecode then the bytecode is run (interpreted),0

@pk the compiler compiles the function definition into a code object full of bytecode and also compiles the def into a creation of a function assigned to the name,1
Hmm. So by the object full of bytecode you mean the actually compiled body of the function correct? And the compiles def into a creation of a function assigned by name  this is some object that.. exists where?,1
@pk the compiled body of the function is a code object yes. The function object that gets created is in memory it's the value of the name: `def func():` func is a variable with a function as its value.,1

@Spooky but you won\'t be able to die even when all life is gone  unless you define immortal as can only be killed by one\'s will,1

@nedbat Sorry I'm still a bit confused about how that def func(): object works. What sort of memory is this amongst what sort of other objects is it? Is it some segment assigned to the interpreter/runtime variables/objects like amongst other byte code something that's not completely like other objects? Or is it just like any other object?,1
Man help channels getting thin. Time to recruit..... Put me in searge!,0
@pk i don't know about segments and you don't need to worry about them in Python. All values are objects on the heap.,1
@pk `x = 1` makes x refer to a 1 object. `def func():` makes func refer to a function object.,0
"@clavlav12 If it\'s something you make yourself you can just make it into a set of strings.```pyflags = {""production backendonly""}```...or a set of enum members:```pyfrom enum import Enumclass BuildFlags(str Enum): Production = production"" BackendOnly = backendonly"" NotifyOps = notifyops"" LogSegfaults = logsegfaults""flags = {BuildFlags.Production BuildFlags.NotifyOps}```that way you can just check if some flag is a member of a set:```py# with strings:if production in flags: ...# with an Enum:if BuildFlags.Production in flags: ...```",1
And lastly what if I actually then call the function? That just takes the value that points to the byte code object and interprets it etc?,1
@pk yes a new frame is created pushed on the frame stack. that frame holds the locals for the function and then the bytecode is executed.,1
Alright thanks a ton @nedbat  really.,0
@pk you might like this: https://pyvideo.org/pyconus2011/pycon2011pythonawarepython.html,0

It's interesting treating functions just like any other objects right off the (ned)bat when they're declared.,0
hihi,0
functions (and classes modules etc) are firstclass objects,0
@pk you can make a list of functions or a dict with functions as values etc.,0
```pydef fn(): ...fn() # compiles runs successfullyfn2 = fnfn2() # compiles runs successfullynumber = 42number() # compiles but fails at runtimedef call(f): f()call(fn) # compiles runs successfullycall(number) # compiles fails at runtime```,1
> It's interesting treating functions just like any other objects right off the (ned)bat when they're declared.@pk a function is just (BASICALLY) an object that has a `__call__` method (and some other stuff).,1
Yeah this whole approach of functions (and classes modules etc) are firstclass objects is interesting and new to me.,0

How do all of you feel about Automate the Boring Stuff with Python book by Al Sweigart?,0
@enz i have been using Python for 20 years and I have a shortcut in Firefox for googling the Python documentation that I use everyday,1
@Dragooner4788 that book is one of the most recommended on this discord,0
I'm currently using to to freshen up since not using Python is a while (about a year) and it's fun so far.,1
> nice because i google alot@enz searching for answers is not inherently bad but the kind of answers you search for can suggest your level of ability.,1
Being a good programmer isn’t about not googling things. It’s (also) about understanding the underlying concepts and best practices being able to collaborate on projects understanding docs and marking the code easy to understand,1
for example if there's some obscure function and you don't remember the parameter order it'd be perfectly natural to Google it.,1
because that's a simple problem to solve.,0
one thing that distinguishes good programmers is their ability to solve highlevel abstract problems.,0
you can\'t Google why does my product have a race condition in this situation,0

and most of the stuff that makes them good is in the higher levels.,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan Just getting your opinion other's welcome. Why is that book specifically recommended?,0

it shouldn't be there. It should be in the user's configuration directory,0
@D. keeping it there might not work for everyone but if you want to keep it there you can use `os.path.dirname(__file__)` to get the directory of where the code is.,1

`try` and `except` are a runtime construct,0
You add a key value pair with dict[key_name] = key_value,0
If I used letters it counted it as name error 🤷\u200d♂️,0
For it being a dict you have to put a value if you don't have the value do```pythondict[key_name] = Null```,0

Let me se if I got it @gm So we have two types of errors runtime and compile... When I run my code it compiles and then runs if when compiling detects an error is a compile error but if the program is running and it detects that a variable doesn't exist for example then it is a run time error.,1

C?,0
> My question is ¿In witch language it does compile?@Deleted User do you mean what language it compiles TO?,0
or what language the compiler is written in?,0
Yes,0
Hmmm I don't know.,0
your Python source code compiles to Python bytecode,0
but the compiler itself is written in C (assuming you use CPython which almost everyone does),0
so basically it's something like this:,0
Yes,0
> so it's `dict[key_name] = new_value` right@Vib yes,0
Yes,0
but what do you mean,0
multiple key: value pairs,0
Or a key with multiple values,0
you have Python source codethe CPython compiler (written in C) compiles it to Python bytecodethe CPython interpreter (also written in C) runs that Python bytecode,1
basically.,0
Alright,0
Bugs stop please,0
> How can i take my py file and encrypt it so > `PyFile.py`> Turns into> `PyFile.exe`> > But... Its encrypted so no one can decrypt it@scotmanehrg did you Google it?,1
What is exactly python bytecode why does it run,0
The interpreter written in C just runs the C code specified in the python bytecode format?,0
> not C code,0
The compiler written in C,0
CPython,0
```py>>> import dis>>> def f(a b):... return a + b...>>> dis.dis(f) 2 0 LOAD_FAST 0 (a) 2 LOAD_FAST 1 (b) 4 BINARY_ADD 6 RETURN_VALUE```,1
see the output of `dis`? that is bytecode.,0
it's basically a lowerlevel representation of your Python code that the interpreter can understand,0
Hmm,0
Wait..,0
> @gm why didn't you do `print(dis.f)@Shivang because in the interpreter output is shown automatically,0
Interpreter doesn't understand normal python code?,0
But why you have to convert it to python bytecode why don't just compile it to C and then the interpreter executes the C code wouldn't that be better?,1
> Interpreter doesn't understand normal python code?@Kronos it's compiled to bytecode first,0
there are mechanisms that let you compile Python to C but they don't provide much performance improvement by themselves.,0
What is the purpose of Python bytecode format then,0
no that's not correct,0
Why creating it if you can compile everything to C?,0
languages are neither compiled nor interpreted,0
implementations are compiled or interpreted,0
okay that's kind of a semantics thing,0
the point is that you could write a Python toolchain that compiles Python code,0
but all common implementations just use interpreters,0
`dict['key']=value`,0
so like there's a technical difference between Python (the abstract language) and CPython Jython IronPython etc. (the implementations),0
Oh,0
So the actual implementation of python is machine code,0
But the language is just a language like Spanish or English?,0

That adds a key to a dictionary and the value of that key is a list.,0
Nice,0
Send a screenshot,0
Hm,0
You can use scripting for automation,0
"`dict[""key""]=value`",0
Vib you have to use = since youre asigning a value to that index but dictionaries don't have indexes instead have keys. It's like doing a an_array[0] = apple,1
I don\'t know much about ML haven\'t done it.But for me Machine Learning is an algorythm which learns from their previous processes or from previous information and plays around with values of variables until getting the perfect number for doing something example in T = 2 increase speed.,1
What are you planning to do in the future what are those passions you're talking about?,0

Hey @FallenThrower!,0
> https://chocolatey.org/install@Deleted User go here,0
First ensure that you are using an administrative shell  you can also install as a nonadmin check out NonAdministrative Installation.Install with powershell.exeNOTE: Please inspect https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1 prior to running any of these scripts to ensure safety. We already know it's safe but you should verify the security and contents of any script from the internet you are not familiar with. All of these scripts download a remote PowerShell script and execute it on your machine. We take security very seriously. Learn more about our security protocols.With PowerShell you must ensure GetExecutionPolicy is not Restricted. We suggest using Bypass to bypass the policy to get things installed or AllSigned for quite a bit more security.Run GetExecutionPolicy. If it returns Restricted then run SetExecutionPolicy AllSigned or SetExecutionPolicy Bypass Scope Process.Now run the following command:SetExecutionPolicy Bypass Scope Process Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol bor 3072; iex ((NewObject System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))Paste the copied text into your shell and press Enter.Wait a few seconds for the command to complete.If you don't see any errors you are ready to use Chocolatey! Type choco or choco ? now or see Getting Started for usage instructions.,1

@weeblet why don’t you want to use if statements?,0
Enums in python?,0
"@weeblet ```pyoptions = { X"": Hello there"", O"": Obione Kenobi""}answer = input()try: print(options[answer])except KeyError: print(""Did you really think that would work?"")```",1
In some scenarios something like this may work. I would probably just use an ifstatement in this case though but it depends on what you’re trying to make it do with the options,1
(Also I haven’t run it since I’m on my phone atm),0
@Vivs what are you quoting? Have you heard about duck typing in python?,0
> what is the dormant section of python help@Kareem The help system ensures that there are always exactly two available help channels. When someone claims them they are moved to occupied and a dormant channel is made available to replace it. When an occupied channel is closed it's moved to the dormant section.,1
It’s the concept of trying something without checking the types first. If it works it’s fine and if it fails you catch the error. I’d recommend this video by Corey Schafer on duck typing https://youtu.be/x3v9zMX1s4s,1
@Vivs What about them?,0
> @Vestergurkan what am i quoting?@Vivs yes that’s what I was asking,0
And @Ansh my message above was to you about duck typing,0
Ah okay,0
@Vivs The help system ensures that there are always exactly two available channels. Available channels are promoted from the pool of dormant channels.,1
So when an available channel is claimed it is replaced by a new one that was previously dormant.,0
If we would have all dormant channels at the top it would be a mess considering how far up the “available help channels” are,1
@Ketz7 I would probably recommend Corey Schafer’s video series on them. They lay a quite solid foundation,0
And simply using classes. You learn by doing,0
:incoming_envelope: :ok_hand: applied warning to @BigBrainMan.,0
@Ansh basically,0
ah,0
so not understanding the thing correctly and messing around with it = duck typing,0
Yep! There are obviously cases where you have to check the type of things so you don’t mess up a database or something but duck typing is generally recommended,1
Is there a way to avoid too many conditionals stacking up ? or is it the way to go?```py if request.method == GET': if current_user.is_authenticated: if current_user.fam: return render_template('home.html') else: # Get todos list todos = Todo.query.filter_by(fam=current_user.fam) renderData = { todos': todos } return render_template('fam_form.html renderData) else: return render_template('signup.html') elif request.method == POST': if entryType := request.form.get('entryType'): if entryType == todo': return createTodoOrError(request.form current_user) # More conditionals follow```,1
Hahah you’ll have to remember the except block as well,0
@Kronos if you can try using if statement1 and statement2:,0
> @Kronos if you can try using if statement1 and statement2:@ItsFab That wouldn't allow me to have different `else` for each condition right?,1

In python you’re generally encouraged to use duck typing,0
@account there's a problem with checking before you do things: in a server environment it could change after you check but before you do.,1

Yeah i deleted my message since discord stripped it of new lines rendering it useless,0
Exactly like that :),0
It’s just a matter of not having a bunch of extra newlines at the end. Have you heard about PEP 8?,1
It sure is,0
Yep basically,0
That’s the thing you didn’t quite follow when having too many blank lines. I think it’s a quite interesting read,0

IMO,0
"If you want to write Python scripts you will need an IDE. IDLE is an IDE however it\'s relatively not complex. There are many IDEs that are made for proper Python script writing notably VSCode (I would suggest going VSCodium instead basically the same as VSCode but better"") PyCharm Atom Sublime Text Vim/Neovim etc.",1
no pycharm good for making your computer into chaos,0
^^^ its good too,0
Yes there are many IDEs in the world. Just keep trying them eventually you will find something that matches your taste.,1
VS is the best,0
agreed,0
IMO,0
I like VSCodium's look and feel just having everything in front of me without having to browse inside 50 menus if I just want to program. For building or stuff like that I do still need to go in menus but one or two it's relatively hard to lose yourself.,1
whats the difference between vscodium and vscode,0
idk lol,0
VSCodium is more privacyaware and I also think there's better GitHub support?,0
Which for me is a big yes,0
@Feroz please dont post links here,0

Try IDEs! I can list a few.,0
use IDLE first,0

^^^^^^^^^^,0
well personal preferences and then Atom coming here with 100% customizability,0
I personally use both Sublime and PyCharm but started with VSC. They are quite different but all work well,0
@Deleted User why u think im indian,0
PyCharm for me is not great. I needed to go through so many menus just to get some simple stuff.,0

oh,0
its ok i dont understand hindi @Deleted User,0
although I am indian,0
> its > its ok i dont understand hindi @Deleted User> @jua state?,0
I have tried Atom seems nice but it's just too customizable and the pylint thing is way too sensible so I started using it as some IDE for finalizing stuff.,1
Yeah. When doing some quicker things I generally like to use Sublime as well @atlas_core. PyCharm is great for any nontiny project though,1
> its ok i dont understand hindi @Deleted User@jua Do you live in foreign,0
Yea no doubt. @Vestergurkan,0
i live in singapore @Deleted User,0

@jua i sent you a friend request,0

I still have yet to try Sublime Text though. It seems even more straightforward minus the extensions for it (such as spotify or TODO trees),1
For that you may want to look at using a search engine to look up the solution.,0
I think someone is trying to figure out how to add something to PATH on Windows.,0

Hi friends! I need to create a web app for only authorized users that's basically CRUD  users of type A are able to add records to the system and see/modify only the records they have added users of type B are able to view/modify all records. It's basically a small app to help organize logistics. My biggest requirement is that it should be built extremely quickly as this is for a humanitarian purpose for a place that's in dire need of urgent logistical help. What tooling/framework/lib would be the quickest way to spin something like this up for someone who knows Python quite well but doesn't have any experience with any of the frameworks/libraries? All input is much appreciated!,1
doesnt google use a ton of telemetry?,0
about what?,0
> doesnt google use a ton of telemetry?,0
its !close,0
does Google TTS have a privacy policy?,0
that uses online services,0
> to interface with Google Translate texttospeech API,0
so Google would use telemetry on that.,0
well people like me that want privacy in life will not get that using gTTS,0
so there is my main problem.,0
i don't like google.,0
well i mean they are fine but as long as I stay away from them and use alternatives I'm fine.,0
Yeah that's you but I want to have privacy.,0
All what I'm asking is are there any alternatives?,0
well had,0
and why should that matter,0
but doesn't Windows have a TTS system builtin?,0
no that's a voice assistant,0
not if I disable that one.,0
like come on I paid 200 dollars.,0
also yes Windows has text to speech.,0
@gra ke subclass ?,0
@NoNameJr245 get this. it is my right as a human being living on this world to prefer privacy and to obtain that privacy.,1
why should i get joked about.,0
then why are you joking about a subject that many people including me take seriously,0
in your opinion but what if i want to use it.,0
is there any way,0
or any other library that doesn't pass through google's data collection,0
i mean of course its not plug and play its not a USB drive. /s,0
aaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,0
god dammit microsoft,0
well thanks anyway..,0
pyttsx3 seems like a good alternative interestingly enough.,0

does kite work with sublime text?,0
@AwesomeCronk what does that mean doesn't abstract things?,0
ok and what do you want?,0
@AwesomeCronk how would you like to handle the command line options? You're still abstracting something by converting the output to values somehow.,1
how does the python bot recognize code?,0
@AwesomeCronk maybe you just want `subprocess.call`?,0
@CodingXeer this is actually not how you would append the string. when you use += on a list you actually use the extend method instead of append. in this case you get the desired result but you wouldn't if the string was longer than one character,1
so `+=` on a list is just the same as `.extend()` ?,0
yes,0
interesting,0
no not really since he'll be very confused when he tries to use += to add ints and it won't work @CodingXeer,1
not what it meant,0
you cant add a full word,0
@CodingXeer because you're actually using the extend method,0
for example: hello,0
on the extend method,0
@PureFunctor :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```['a b hello']```,0
huh,0
still simpler to use `append`,0
imo,0
damn that is exactly what I said,0

HEYY,0
so guys i have a quick question,0
How would I make it so that the thing that I enter will be searched in google?,0
If i have 2 loops one inside the other (nested) like this:```pywhile True: for i in range(whatever): do_stuff()```And i want to call `continue` to restart the outside loop (`while True:`) from inside the nested loop how can i go about that?This of course doesn't work:```pywhile True: for i in range(whatever): do_stuff() continue```,1
In reality the loops i use in my actual code are.. a bit fuller than that but for something like this it doesn't matter whatever i do in between..,1
please help?,0
yes i KNOW,0
please read the text,0
yeah i know it doesn't,0
it's pretty obvious,0
bro..,0
please read the question,0
i need to call continue for the outside loop but i need to call it from the INSIDE loop,0
what's the whois cmd for the bot?,0
hi is there a ms module (in nodejs) alternative for python?,0
"like a module that allows me to enter any format of time like:""ms(""2 days""); and it returns the time to me in milliseconds",1
I don't need milliseconds really anything works but I need a parser,0
yes. 2 days to any time format,0
strftime? alright ill look through it,0
,0
do you think this is possible?,0
What are you trying to do?,0
nonono,0
i wanna see if you know,0
of course it's possible,0
yup,0
heres one solution:```pyh = lambda: h```,0
```pydef h(): def a(): def b(): def c(): pass return c return b return ah()()()()```,0
This is one way,0
it just has to return a function,0
yeah,0
but its nice,0
Maybe this would work...: ```pydef h(): return hh()()()()()()()()```,0
Regex helpi want to find a.....d but it shudnt match a....\\d'I tot `r'a.?(?!\\\\)d'` will wrk but it doesnt,0
yes it would work,0
Yeah that works,0
h = lambda: h,0
that wud also,0
is shorter,0
> if u break it it will continue the while loop(provided that u dont have anything trailing the for loop in the while loop)@Zlanthris Otonashi i have stuff after that inner loop,1
h=lambda:h,0
i'll give you more context,0
no that wouldn't work because h isn't defined,0
that inner loop is a check of sorts and if what it checks for isn't what it should be it should restart that loop,1
@Notepad here's a fun example,0
"!e ```pydef h(): print(""Hello"") return hh()()()()```",0
@Vestergurkan :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```001 | Hello002 | Hello003 | Hello004 | Hello```,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan It ud wrk because it calls h after we call it,0
,0
doesn't it have to evaluate the right side first?,0
No,0
it evaluvates only when we call it,0
thats why lambdas are used in tkinter buttons,0
because we dont want it calling unneccesary functions on start,0
ah yeah,0
@Zlanthris Otonashi I'm a bit confused which parameter allows me to get the seconds quantity of the entire string?,0
Which channel is related to regex?,0
for datetime.datetime.strptime(),0
I can't use it with a mere string can I?,0
Do I need to combine the both of them strptime and strftime,0
Yes,0
```pyif [a b c] not in d: #do stuff```is this equal to ```pyif a not in d or b not in d or c not in d: #do stuff```,1
oh,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan it would work,0
lambda: h,0
why not ?,0
So how do I make use of it? What argument can I use to get the amount of seconds milliseconds or microseconds?,1
!paste @CumSock pls,0
,0
what did i do,0
idk no lambda @Zlanthris Otonashi,0
it's annonoyms that much ik,0

if it has then how many times,0
Hey @Secret!,0
the easiest way is to use the count method,0
does it work? @Secret,0

the compiler turns high level code (what we write) and turns it into low level code (what the computer understands) and then the interpreter turns that code into bytecode? is that how python code executes?,1
so i guess that's how you write it,0
if input == secret word,0
does python compile its code?,0
don't think so,0
ahh ok i thgought for the longest time it did,0
it compiles into intermediary bytecode,0
wait so the interpreter doesnt get used?,0
so apparently it does lul sry,0
or the interpreter is the one who compiles it?,0

how would I do that,0
@slither code doesn't d.py already have decorators that can check for roles?,0
yes but I also need it for else statements and stuff,0
there are no else statements in the decorators,0

whats the problem,0
I need to code a program that can satisfy this,0
oh,0
solve for X ?,0
if i put a value of 2 then answer must be the same if you calculate x = pi/4(pi/4)  (pi/4^3) / 3,1
for any given value,0
@n0tKaiPan why `2i+n`?,0
1. Create a program that ask the user for the value of i (number of iterations). Then make a formula that satisfies the series above. Convert this formula then to a program code (Mathlab or Excel Python)2. Starting with the simplest version sin x = 1 add terms one a time to estimate sin (π/4). After each new term is added compute the true and approximate percent relative errors. Use your pocket calculator to determine the true value. Add terms until the absolute value of the approximate error estimate falls below an error criterion.3. Then create a program that allows you to compute the value of Ea and Et using the results from computing approximate error current approximation and previous approximation.4. Then plot the results. this one is I will make,1
> @n0tKaiPan why `2i+n`?@nedbat is there any other way that exponent will be just odd numbers?,0
why not +1 ?,0
+1 where?,0
`2i+1`?,0
instead of +n,0
let me trty,0
@n0tKaiPan wait don't try it yet.,0
this isn't trial and error: you should have a reason for why the code is the way it is,0

Okay let me explain this is the one I got in my mindif I will enter 1 then that would be 20+1 = 1 right?then 2 is 21+1=3then if 3 22+1=5,1
oh ok just wondering have a nice day,0
but still got the wrong answer huhu,0
@n0tKaiPan you ask for the number of iterations then pass it as `value`. Good variable names can make it easier to see the logic of the program.,1
"```>>>text = World"">>> # is there a way to split World into like this?:W o r l d```",0
@nedbat answer must be 0.704626512 if the value i put is 2 and the output is 0.08074551218828077,0
@n0tKaiPan right we know: it doesn't get the right answer. I'm trying to talk about why that is.,0
@nedbat yup the program as for the number of iterations,0
ok thx,0
call it `iterations` then.,0
@n0tKaiPan and then you'd have `n = iterations  1` and you will wonder what is that for?,0

Hey @vyper!,0
@vyper did you write it?,0
```pyfrom math import factorial pidef maclaurin(iterations): trueval=0.7071067812 x = pi/4 for i in range(iterations):  a = (x  (2i+1)) / (factorial(2i+1)) if i % 2 == 0: a = 1 output = x  a return outputiterations = int(input('Input the Number of iteration: ))if iterations==1: trueval=0.7071067812 x = pi/4 et = (((truevalx)/trueval)100)1  print('\\\t Order: 0') print('Approximation Error is : x) print('True iterations is : trueval) print('Et is : et)  elif iterations>=2: print(maclaurin(iterations))```now this is correct,1
thanks @nedbat hehe,0
@vyper can you ask a more specific question? What part don't you understand?,0
stupid is a harsh word,0
@nedbat it will be correct if it's 2 iterations but it's 3 iterations it goes wrong again,0
@nekitdev what's the best you could suggest?,0
we are dealing with this,0
if you could any program work and simplier so i could understand,0

thats a tuple,0

And you can convert a tuple to a list with list(),0
"@Raf what do you mean by  I have some integers""? How do you have them? in what form?",0
hello everyone!,0
I think he just wants to convert a sequence of integers to a list,0
so list(),0
@Deleted User it depends what that sequence actually is,0
you could have a set,0

> imagine doing webdev with python@Deleted User why did you say this?,0
@nedbat I just think javascript is better for it has a lot more applications and frameworks;Python is fine but it has better uses than webdev,1
as someone who does webdev for Python I don't feel like I'm missing out,0
Python is widely used for backend webdev.,0
@Infinimata what stack? lmaooooooooooooooooooooooo,0
It's one of its main use cases statistically speaking.,0
web dev is like top 2 most popular application of python,0
@Deleted User Refrain from being disrespectful to other users.,0
@Deleted User do you want actual answers or did you just come here to sneer?,0
pretty sure i just asked a question.,0
@Deleted User Pretty sure lmaooooooooooooooooooooo is condescending and rude.,0
i am very slow at learning python can someone tell me how much time you guys took to learn python basics,1
And my opinion is the one that matters here. So cut it out.,0
everyone learns differently and doesn't start from the same starting point @Mr.Pathetic dw about others,0
roifl,0
yes focus more on your own diligence and projects than the timeframe.,0
your views of what constitutes the basic also may not match someone else's,0
ok,0
but its been a week and im just on lists and touples and all that stuff,0
that's fine,0
@Mr.Pathetic yeah you just got started. This stuff takes a while to sink in. But it's always best to match your learning with making projects of some kind even if they're very simple ones,1
as long as you feel like you\'re learning something and not just i read it once so i master it you\'ll be just fine,1
there's a command that shows a list of projects plenty to choose from,0

I like having just headers from that type of stuff @fix error,0
oo ok,0
So like```py# HACK:# blabla# bleble# blublu```,0
Will fix soon ™️,0
I like to grep for some keywords in comments later on and adding it on every line is clutter for my output,1
same for `TODO(xxx):` `FIXME:` etc,0
> Will fix soon ™️@fix error fix error?,0
> I like having just headers from that type of stuffsometimes I need a `#FORGET_ALL_HOPE_YE_WHO_ENTER_HERE` tag,0
@pot head if you’re developing an iOS app like a game you’ll use Swift/SwiftUI/Obj C. Probably SwiftUI nowadays,0
@pot head keep in mind that games of that scope require a good deal of skill to put together,0
@fix error I guess try to avoid needing hacks in the first place as much as possible. I find the situation you describe to be very rare in practice. But if it's unavoidable I would comment each hacky line individually to properly demarcate and explain each instance properly.,1
if you want to get more serious about gamedev it's best to pursue that in the channel devoted to it: #gamedevelopment,1
@Jeremy It’s one part of the process just like developing the game. If you view it as being a tiny thing that isn’t really a task to get done then yeah it’ll be huge. Graphics design is a broad topic with a lot of things to learn and it’s as difficult as programming but just a different skill,1
i am game designer,0
but not dev,0
i mainly design game for android ios,0
too bad at programming,0
im an artist 😄,0
seems fitting since it is a programming server,0
i am trying to get batter at programming so i can make living out of it,0
Yep. I personally do both development and design work. Either way let’s get back to discussing python,0
ok,0
@Deleted User I'm curious what you think is lacking in the Python web dev stacks?,0
they like it more,0

@nedbat compare it to MERN or some other JS stack it's definitely inferior,0

"l = [5,3,4][i  1 for i in l]",0
you can either use `map` or you can use numpy if you have to do a lot of numerical operations on arrays,1
I'd definitely recommend numpy if you're doing that same operation across a decent number of arrays or doing something similar on larger ones. But it'd probably be overkill if it's just that operation in isolation.,1
numpy if you're doing it a lot but if you just do it once just use list comprehension,0
lol ok,0
no,0
@realp A quick pure Python solution would be `[a  b for a b in zip(list_a list_b)]`,0
"`starmap(binop,zip(list1,list2))`",0
[j  l2[i] for i j in enumerate(l1)],0
ew no,0
zip better,0
zip is slower if your lists are shorter than ~40? elements,0
or somewhere around that,0
are we really microoptimizing a list comp,0
~~write raw bytecode~~,0
tbh i think list(map()) looks nicer than a list comp,0
@Numerlor takes time to import numpy so not using numpy is faster here,0
or you can just do `zipwith = map`,0

@NICK You're trying to install something for which there is no Python 3.9 prebuilt binary yet. You need to install an earlier version of Python like 3.8,1

the screenshot you posted indicated you were using `pip`,0
so `py 3.8 m pip install r requirements.txt`,0
q quiet Give less output. Option is additive and can be used up to 3 times (corresponding to WARNING ERROR and CRITICAL logging levels).,1
We see a lot of errors in this vein because people are upgrading prematurely to 3.9,0

python often refers to python 2,0
which is different,0
Hmm,0
many people use py 3,0
Yeah. That’s the only maintained version,0
^,0
Python 3.9 is the latest version but 3.8 is the version I’d recommend using at the moment since that’s what is most widely supported,1
There aren’t any real plans python 4 yet but if it’ll happen it will be much less dramatic than the step from python 2 to 3. Python 3.10 is already being developed though,1
python 4 won't happen for a very long time if ever,0

Python is compiled to bytecode as needed when you run it,0
https://twitter.com/gvanrossum/status/1306082472443084801?s=21,0
@nedbat do you know why python 3.10 is on the master branch? Maybe I’m missing something about how the versions are structured in the CPython repo?,1
@Defxult you don't have `self` so probably not depending on what you mean.,0
@Vestergurkan 3.9 shipped so now master is 3.10,0
@Vestergurkan there's a 3.9.x branch for 3.9 fixes,0
But that’s not the stable version yet?,0
3.9 is stable,0
3.9.0 shipped on Oct 5,0
I mean that 3.10 isn’t stable and a master branch is generally or stable versions,0
The master branch is for the latest development that works. 3.10 alpha.,0
@60x .pyc files have compiled bytecode. its used unless the source changes.,0
So I assume there’s also a python 3.11 branch floating around or isn’t that a thing yet?,0
it isn't a thing yet,0
there are multiple possible git workflows,0
@Vestergurkan no that won't happen until 3.10 ships,0
having the current shipped version on master is one of them,0
Ah okay,0
Ah I see. Thanks,0
It does but I’d recommend doing it in #botcommands,0

Hehe,0
and also posting full solutions for something is not helpful to anyone,0
I already had that much... Only thing is that he pointed out th fact I could use MOD for it,0
Either way I’d say there are two steps to soling this:1. Find the square root of the number2. See if that’s an integer and not a float valueAt least that’s one way of doing it,1
❌,0
the other way is to lookup a table of perfect squares,0
unless 12.0 counts as an integer,0
it returns a floating point number,0
It does if you do the second step right,0
mathematically it is not in python though,0
How would you do the second step?,0
That’s the question I’m asking you. Give it a try,0

if junior developers are beginners then i'm not even a freshman,0

Is this even right?,0
it always returns a 0 cuz python calculates fast XD,0

Pause... modulus doesn't work on a noninteger 🤔,0
im still learning decorators so i missed it,0
then i use base64 to encode that?,0

yeah pretty sure,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx what are you going to do with this image?,0
@nedbat i am trying to encode it so i can send this to a program i've asked the program dev they said i need to encode to base64 first,1
is this what encoded look like?,0
looks ok at first glance,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx that looks right,0
ok good,0
why would you slice when you can split,0
"> It does if you do the second step right@Vestergurkan ```pydef is_square(number): print(f""Square root is {sqrt(number)}"") if str(sqrt(number)).endswith("".0""): return True return False```This is what I did",1
why not just do n // (n  0.5) == n / (n \\\\ 0.5),0
That won’t quite work. I’d recommend checking out a method called `is_integer()`,0
oh wait,0

you can do it,0
yeah i still gotta wait 2 years until i write my first `import __hello__`,0
anyways you can do it,0
i believe in you,0
holy shit why are you already doing discord bots,0
you are a prodigy good sir,0
btw you're missing the @ on your decorator,0

@PKarpNondo y not,0
@エニラ congrats on being able to write already!!,0

@zade u gotta define guess,0
if question != Yes then guess is undefined,0
@Shahprogrammer looks fine to me,0
Is there a chat to ask general coding approaching questions,0
I want to make notes on how i would approach this question before coding it,0
@zade if question isn\'t Yes then you never define guess,0
I don't want anyone to code it but how i would go about doing it,0

@Alxne id recommend not using an IDE to start learning syntax,0
@Alxne using an ide is ok,0
that's not how you do that,0
it fixes syntax for you sometimes,0
? it does?,0
because it points out your mistakes,0
its good but ^,0
Just chuck him in cmd or IDLE >:),0
tbh i don't think that matters too much you'll learn the syntax soon enough even with an ide,0
and what's wrong with it pointing out the mistakes?,0
^,0
i see no calculus,0
stop giving me ptsd,0
1) your list is called list1,0
2) Where did you learn list comprehensions?,0
what are you trying to do exactly?,0
i'm really curious as to where you learnt list comprehensions,0
just use a regular for loop for that,0
> me?@Takos Yes,0
💀,0
Hey @PKarpNondo!,0
🤨,0
Umm... What is the exact difference between print and return?,0
oh wow,0
result is not defined,0
@PKarpNondo what are those lambdas for?,0
😂 WHAT DID YOU DOOOO @Alxne 😂,0
when you use an input statement it promps immediately,0
@PKarpNondo sorry for introducing dicts when you weren't ready,0
you entered the second line of your code as your input 💀,0
@エニラ what were the lambdas for?,0
no there's a very good reason why i chose to use dicts instead of spamming conditionals,0
check the screen shot,0
btw what is lambda?,0
the lambdas were as a placeholder for whatever you wanted it to do @nedbat,0
what does it do?,0
never used lambdas,0
it's an anonymous function,0
pause,0
that... wouldn't... work,0
reread his list comp again,0
no i'm literally 3.9 years old,0
he's taking the capitalized form of whatever passes whatever check,0
it would make more sense to do a for loop where if the value is less than 5 characters long set it to .upper() then append it to the list,1
@PKarpNondo i don;t think you want lambdas at all,0
hold on @PKarpNondo imma fix it please don't use things that you don't know in the future. this was my fault this time.,1
i simply used lambdas as placeholders,0
"```pymylist = [""WORD ANOTHER WORD ONE_MORE AGAIN""]new_list = []for x in mylist: if len(x) <= 5: new_list.append(x.upper()) else: new_list.append(x.capitalize())```",0
should not have done that,0
or something like that...,0
> Also lambda is inefficient@Slow are they?,0
they want to append the .capitalize() form if it is has 6 or more characters @marc Not just straight up ignore them,1
i don't prefer them either but we might as well use real reasons 🙂,0
Pause... @Takos,0
what is going into this new list?Only words that are less than or equal to 5 characters?,0
or all?With the ones less than 5 characters Uppercased and the rest Capitalized?,0
right,0
"```pys = str.lower(input(\'Which grocery store did you shop at? Walmart Fortinos Instacart or Gateway?\\'))d1 = {\'walmart\ \'fortinos\ \'instacart\ \'gateway\'}d2 = {\'delivery\ \'pickup\'}if s in d1: s = str.lower(input(\'Did you use delivery or pickup?\\')) if s in d2: print(f\'You chose the method of {s}\\') else: print(""It seems you have chosen a method not listed."")else: print(""It seems you have chosen a store not listed."")```",1
@PKarpNondo,0
Aite... have fun,0
probably not best practices but you can copy and paste it; please refrain from using code that you don't understand in the future. that was my fault this time.,1
yeah,0
but that's not allowed by discord,0
if you wanna be extra extra sure that they don't ban you for it you should go into whatever library you're using and maybe change the user agent or whatever the equivalent of that is,1
but tbh i don't think discord cares that much (please don't take my word on that),0
you can't dm yourself so you'd have to use a bot account,0
do like on message if word in message dm user,0
what channel is this? i can take a look if needed,0

@Takos you can make a new list: `short_words = [w for w in all_the_words if len(w) < 5]`,0

what do you mean by all other namespaces?,0
sys.modules is every module that has been imported. wouldn't that be enough?,0
you want the names of all the globals in all the imported modules?,0
no sys.modules is only modules that have been imported.,0
(but they may have been imported by Python to get started),0
> wait. let me check because it doesn't make sense that youtubedl shows up in this code. maybe I'm high@<Alex> hmm there may be a .pth file that is affecting the imports.,1
@<Alex> but i don't understand yet why you want to look at all the imported modules? Are you trying to list loaded extensions?,1
many modules don't include license info.,0
or you will look up the licenses separately?,0
I see. why do you need globals() in there?,0
oh intersection. i see sorry.,0
you might as well just look at globals and see if they are a module or not.,0
sys.modules is not every module on the computer. It's only what has been imported,0
@<Alex> can you check again why youtubedl is in your sys.modules? It shouldn't be in there.,0
and also ytdl is against youtube's tos,0
ok that's kind of irrelevant here 🙂,0
that is true,0
@<Alex> that doesn't surprise me: it's the stdlib modules that Python uses.,0
you don't need globals(),0
anything you import will be in sys.modules,0
i don't see why you need to save this list.,0
look up everything in sys.modules. The stdlib won't have metadata in pkgresources.,0
why not just track them when you import them?,0
or is there something all the extensions have in common? You can examine the module object.,0
@<Alex> what about thirdparty modules this system also imports? How will you skip those?,0
@<Alex> then you just want to skip stdlib modules?,0
there will be others than what is in this list.,0
and this list will shift as Python changes over time.,0
is it safe to use pyproject.toml instead of setup.py for simple apps? Newer versions of pip seem to support it.,0
what about other stdlib modules that your system imports?,0
@Deleted User yes people love it,0
@nedbat hi I recognize your name from irc iirc 🙂,0
@<Alex> perhaps one of your extensions loads a stdlib module?,0
@Deleted User i'm unavoidable,0
@<Alex> do you want thirdparty modules to show as Unknown or would you rather skip over them?,0
I understand you aren't the only contributor but don't your extensions all have something in common? Some way they hook into the system?,1
does pyproject.toml still require a setup.py shim to work properly? I'm asking because I went from setup.py to poetry and now that pyproject.toml appears to work with pip directly I'm looking to convert my poetry pyproject.toml to work with pip (it actually appears to work by default though),1
how do i remove the b in this img,0
@<Alex> since you want thirdparty also I would try to use pkg_resources to understand for each module whether it was pipinstalled or not. don't try to specialcase the stdlib,1

no...,0
it's not raw_icon_Done.decode(raw_icon),0
i can't use sort,0
```pyraw_icon_Done.decode(raw_icon)``` @nedbat,0
like that? or ```pyraw_icon_Done.decode(raw_icon) = base64.b64encode(raw_done)```,0
Just say your question,0

image,0
can pillow draw a image on base64 image?,0
like encoded @Bast,0
you need to install it,0

can anyone tell me how could i take a number of inputs based on a `x = int(input)` i mean like the number in `x` should be the number of times the compooter will ask for `input()`,1
can pillow draw a things on this image? without saving it like it uses Base64 string then can pillow draw things in the string?,1
then idk,0
sry,0
hm,0
oh yeah,0

> can anyone tell me how could i take a number of inputs based on a `x = int(input)` i mean like the number in `x` should be the number of times the compooter will ask for `input()`@Deleted User no the `x` is only a variable through which you can get the input of the value and the `int` means its gonna be an integer for the program,1
nvm,0
got it,0
you can't compare a list with an int and get a meaningful result,0
you cannot compare an integer to a list,0
so it causes an error,0
cuz the list might contain strings,0
so,0
that's not appropriate,0
does anyone know how could i write things to file without deleting the things i wrote previously,0

without re writing,0
kind of,0

but i dont want to delete the old one,0
"> you can open the file in append mode or a""ohhhhhhhhk",0
so now,0
how can i change line after writing everything,0
i hv different inputs which contain the things i hv to append in the file,0
and when i do,0
"```py with open(""test.csv a"") as f: f.write(""\ inp)```",0
i write the stuff in,0
but,0
it is all in the same line,0
`one1`,0
here i had 2 inputs to write in,0
`one` is 1st input and `1` is the second input,0
i want them to be in different lines,0
nvm,0
got it,0
just had to append `\` to the file in another `with` statment,0

I have to write a bunch of strings to a file well over a million. They're generated one by one. Should I write each string to the file as it's generated or add it to a list and write the entire list in the end? How much will file I/O slow down my code?Note: I use an HDD if that's a factor.,1

well having an HDD is a big factor,0
my guess would be that writing in batches is the best,0
but I'm not sure,0
you could also have a separate thread just for writing,0

so i buffer it alright.,0
> @Deleted User so I think I have an idea what's wrong. I tried another input program it ran on my powershell but it's just not working with turtle@rz uhh then try updating turtle,1
so you have a producer thread that generates the string and a consumer thread that buffers and writes in batches,0
i gues that'd work,0
but yeah profile it,0
> wym updating turtle@rz well the version u'r using might be outdated,0
How would I go about implementing a thread for that?```pyfor _ in range(1 million): data = generate_data()```^ pseudocode obviously.I have near zero knowledge about `threading` except when I copypasted from SO.,1
@Deleted User do you know the basics of threading?,0
the concept not like Python's implementation,0
Somewhat. Not enough to explain to someone else.,0
It's like knowing a word's meaning by its context rather than knowing its definition.,0
okay,0

> can anyone tell if there is a module to round a number in the standard library@Deleted User `round` builtin function,1
@Deleted User yes,0
oh,0
@Deleted User so basically you need four things:1. a data structure that will contain strings that have been generated but not yet written2. a function to generate strings and put them in the data structure3. a function to take strings from the data structure and consume them4. code to run 2 and 3 in separate threads,1
for 1 I suggest `queue` which is in the stdlib. you already have 2 and 3 so you just need to work out how to use `threading` for point 4.,1
```Traceback (most recent call last): File /storage/emulated/0/python programes/alarm.py line 15 in <module> EOFError: EOF when reading a line``` this is the eror,1
@Deleted User I'm fairly sure the error is from an earlier line,0
post say line 10 to 15,0
```import timefrom pygame import mixerday = int(input(\'Day: \'))hour = int(input(\'Hour: \'))minute = int(input(\'Minute: \'))seconds = int(input(\'Seconds: \'))final_value = (day  86400) + (hour  3600) + (minute  60) + secondswhile final_value >= 0:\tprint(final_value)\ttime.sleep(1)\tfinal_value = 1\tif final_value == 0:\t\tbreakmixer.init()mixer.music.load(\'/SD card/snaptube/download/SnapTube Audio/Bazzi  Mine (lyrics)  (MP3_160k).mp3\')mixer.play()``` this is the full code and```Traceback (most recent call last): File /storage/emulated/0/python programes/alarm.py line 15 in <module> EOFError: EOF when reading a line``` this is the error,1

> @gm How would that work in threads? The data has to be generated first then written.@Deleted User yup so the consumer thread just polls the queue and blocks until there's data for it to do stuff with,1
> @Deleted User yup so the consumer thread just polls the queue and blocks until there's data for it to do stuff with@gm So do I `while` loop until there's data in the data structure? I genuinely have no idea how to go about doing this.,1
you should probably check the `threading` module's documentation,0
I believe there's an example there,0
check also the `queue` module's documentation,0
the function for popping stuff from the queue will block until it contains data,0
so you don't need an explicit loop,0

@Inheritance ♦ looping over dict.items gives you tuples of key value pairs,0
ohhhhh they give a tuple?,0
Anyone know django ?,0
Anyone know MySQL?,0
so im making a help command(not discord bot) how could i not hard code,0
should i use classes and stuff?,0
what is the int for red colour?,0
What is hard code?,0
@o0o0keem can u teach me because I am making app but the interface is not good?,0
no im asking what could i do,0
to not hard code,0
Methods for self iteration in lists for python ?,0
I'm sorry but what does hard code mean?,0
> What is hard code?typing in values normally which are not dynamic i think,0
Oh I understand,0
Ok,0
so what could i do?,0
hmmmmm,0
@o0o0keem django is used for frontend or backend?,0
@Deleted User Check discord.js guide page it says how to do so (In javascript) but you could try to use the same.What they did in that tutorial was to create a file for each command so ping.py was the command .py then to dynamicaly build each command they grab every .py file in the \'commands\ directory and read it,1
If u have time I will be pleased to teach me,0

i got the thing i think will work,0
@BigBrainMan ya,0
Sure,0
Yes I do understand that but you could use the same method as in JavaScript since they used node js to do the bot @Deleted User [https://discordjs.guide/commandhandling/dynamiccommands.html],1
if there are problems i will ask,0
hm,0
Do the same instructions but with Python,0
oh thats command handling i could use that too,0
kk thanks i will try if it doesnt work my way.,0
Alright have fun I hope it works.,0
"can you guys help me in how i should approach this problem?So take a random sentence say I am Brim"".I need to add `.` after each letter and a `..` after each word.And a space after that so it looks clean.So the output should look like```py>>> I.. a.m.. B.r.i.m..```How would i like start approaching this issue? I can do it fine with just one dot but i dont know how to do the `..` part.",1
You could do a .replace( .') first for adding the dots per letter and then replace(  ..') to add two dots per word,1
Is there an inbuilt library for displaying a calendar?,0
ok ill try that,0
Another way you could solve this problem is to first split the string (split method) in every space so you have an array of words for each word replace( .') and then join everything in that array with 2 dots ..'.join(array_of_dotted_words),1
ohh yeah i tried using replace but it kinda messed up,0
mhm ok,0
Yeah I was wrong with the first solution,0
ok this should work,0
"so i need to do `my_string = string_split.split("""")` right?",0
```cs1 Split your string in to every word and assign it to a list with string.split( )2 For every element in that list word.replace( .') so you add a dot per letter in words3 Then join that array in to a string with .join method ..'.join(array_of_dotted_words) to separate each word with 2 dots.``` @BrimCap,1
Oh,0
Anyways good night good luck with your projects,0
👏 👏,0
> remarks on https://paste.pythondiscord.com/geguzeqaye.py ??@Unstoppable9160 you posted that literally 3 minutes ago.,0
patience is a virtue.,0
anyway after `import time` you have `from datetime import time`,0
the last import takes precedence.,0
> i know i am waiting for a solution@Unstoppable9160 precisely...so there is no real need to keep asking. someone will get to it eventually or you could use your own help channel #❔｜howtogethelp,1
> @gm i dont think i follow@Unstoppable9160 okay so if you look at your imports,0
you have `import time` then a few lines down you have `from datetime import time` right?,0
so now the `time` name refers to the `time` from `from datetime import time` since that was the later import,0
don't do `from datetime import time` use `import datetime; datetime.time`,0
that way you don't overwrite the name,0
What's the answer of O(n2) + O(1) + O(n) + O(n) = ?,0
in this case how about you just do `from time import sleep`?,0
since you only want that function,0
yeah true,0
> What's the answer of O(n2) + O(1) + O(n) = ?@Deleted User what do you think it is?,0
by n2 do you mean n^2?,0
Ya,0
"@o0o0keem im getting an `Empty Seperator` error when i do `string.split("""")`",0
okay so what do you think?> Ya@Deleted User,0
yw,0
you can also do `from datetime import date time` (for example),0
O(n^2) I think,0
> O(n^2) I think@Deleted User why?,0
ohh ok,0
yeah thats what i tried to do,0
> hello what is runtime error@Kazuki you mean `RuntimeError`?,0
basically any error that doesn't have a more specific classification,0
why do you ask?,0
A runtime error is a program error that occurs while the program is running,0
If O(n2) = C1If O(n) = c2If O(1) = c3 Then = Nxc1 + Nxc2 + c3 = Nxc1 + Nxc2 = C1 grows fast so the the answer is C1 = O(n^2),1
> If O(n2) = C1> If O(n) = c2> If O(1) = c3 > Then = Nxc1 + Nxc2 + c3 = Nxc1 + Nxc2 = C1 grows fast so the the answer is C1 = O(n^2)@Deleted User more or less yes,1
you want just `else:`,0
a number is either less than 0 more than 0 or 0.,0
but honestly these sites really suck.,0
@gm thanks for answer,0
@Deleted User basically just look at the fastest growing term and isolate that,0
Ok,0
> what can be done to solve it then?@Kazuki replace that line with just `else:`,0
swap else with elif ^,0
not get rid of ....,0
"> this is so confusing why is it this way@Kazuki `elif`is else if"".",0
which means if the preceding conditions were not satisfied but this condition is,0
`else` is just if all preceding conditions were not satisfied,0
> in this case a bare else works@Flash. there's the edge case of `nan` but I suppose that doesn't matter,0

Wow,0

honestly WPM is kind of like disk IO...it only matters if you actually have that much meaningful data to transmit at once,1

@Kronos 2nd,0
Always prefer absolute imports and never explicitly import `__init__`,0
Okay,0
@Ajay this is a consequence of the implementation of integers in cpython it happens that small integers are interned so when you assign 5 to 2 variables they refer to the exact same 5 but tuples don't use that mechanism,1
Why when I use pyinstaller I see 2 file do I need to keep both or one can be deleted,0
The one with python icon has .app on the end and other one does not,0

You must properly build your project so that it is added to your packages path,0

String literals are stored in the program so that we can just point to the same address when a string is reused it can technically also be used for sharing memory between strings but I don't think this is used in python,1
You should be able to pip install your package,0

guys,0
pls help me,0
!tools here's a nice list of editor worth checking out. I'd personally recommend a combination of PyCharm and Sublime Text depending on the application though VSCode is also nice. Regardless I'd generally recommend that you try to use an editor without too many features in the beginning so you don't only rely on the IDE features like auto correct for coding,1

What isn't working about it?,0
`num is not iterable`,0
or int is not iterable or something,0
unless that actually works then the issue is line 5 `range num`,0
you need parentheses,0
I think there may be a different error since `for i in range num` isn't saying `range(num)`,0
!e range num,0
@Vestergurkan :x: Your eval job has completed with return code 1.```001 | File <string> line 1002 | range num003 | ^004 | SyntaxError: invalid syntax```,1
This is what I'm expecting,0
@Vestergurkan #botcommands i was right !,0
yep and also you can't convert an int to a list that way,0
`range` is a function that you're trying to call with some `int` as the argument. To call a function you have to put parenthesis,1

where and how?,0

What kind of simulation?,0
What are the downsides of creating my own unique ids with random ?,0
Yeah,0
not able to find iit,0
@CodingXeer,0
@Kronos you may get the same IDs many times,0
@CodingXeer you crashed my VS,0
Off still recommend snowflakes for many things,0
How does snowflakese prevent collisions ?,0
@itsLauren that should be possible. I don’t know how the graphics would be made though,0
They have a timestamp and such things. Two things aren’t processed in the same core at the exact same time,0
so how do i put a limit to it?,0
Does snowflakes allow creation of unique ids with a particular length i provide ?,0
and can i put a time interval?,0
Nope. They’re kind of a fixed size,0
k,0
and the frequency limit?,0
But if you’re just doing something simple it’s possible to just increment by 1 every time,0
First ID is 0 next is 1 next is 2 3 4...,0
?????,0
sry for such noob questions,0
yes i do,0
i mean it should update three times and output the next line then,0
Ah cool,0
I have that  But it's going to be part of an invite link so  i feel like 0 and 1 would look weird  lol,1
Then start at 1626,0
And keep counting from there,0
why did you say 1626 ?,0
then start counting from 48239,0
what is special about 1626?,0
Just a random number haha. You can pick any,0
"What happens if i use `with open(""f.txt"")` in a coroutine?",0
Does it block the loop?,0
uhhh thank you,0
got it cleared,0
> then start counting from 48239@✪ SavagePastaMan Thanks man without you i would have wasted a lot of time searching for the perfect random number,1

Why don't you want an internal monologue?,0
uh internal monologue?,0
talking to yourself mentally,0

If i wanted random ids which includes not just numbers but alpha+num+specialchar and is of a custom length i provide. what module would be the way to go? @Vestergurkan,1
`random.choice`,0
pretty broad question but if I want to build a SaaS web app which only partly contains an open source not built by me am I liable for suing?Not really familiar with open source,1
> `random.choice`@Deleted User,0
Hmm,0
if they can visualize then they're doing the same thing,0
Yep,0
sure ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯,0
but take this to an off topic chat,0
I generally visualize things in my head when creating them. No need to speak to myself about it unless I’m trying to formulate something,1
> @Vestergurkan basically people who don't have internal monologue  can't think in sentences  they can only have visual pattern or image something like so how they can be a programmer without having a skills to talk in head u know what i mean@Slow send me link 2 me the download internal monologue i am download that and i am pro,1
which type of output you want that took much time do it by your self i gave you hint@CodingXeer ok but can you atleast tell where do i put the `\\r`?,1
Hey @Vestergurkan If i wanted random ids which includes not just numbers but alpha+num+specialchar and is of a custom length i provide. what module would be the way to go?,1

no it won't since you used namespaces,0
I don’t know. Try searching something about it. There’s probably something similar available,0
wokay..,0
@Kronos use random.choices,0
is `random.choices` and `random.randint` the same?,0
no?,0

did you read the docs at all,0
no..,0
!docs random.choices,0
not the whole,0

hm maybe that could help,0
yes it does,0
and how do i make a sequence?,0
oh ok,0
so randint cannot pick between strings right?,0
well it's not necessarily a string or number,0
cz its not possible,0
randint picks a random int hence the name,0
oh ok thanks,0
got it,0

First make a simpler one and check if it's working then imlement all these features or that you are doing,0
how your program should run and your control flow you are using so many if's,0
use elif's and if you need to do more checks indent if's into elif's,0

well if you make the 1 negative and ignore the middle numbers then it sums to 8,0
if i call an asynchronous method in a synchronous function and call the synchronous function in an asynchronous loop will the synchronous function call block even if it's doing something asynchronous?,1
It's right but its showing sum sum=n+n,0

i'd say thats unethical hacking,0

they said cracking passwords and hacking wifi passwords which as far as I know is unethical,0
Usually you'd use pyhton to automate a test that covers all the bases of a system checking for different vulnerabilities and such,1

also no point in coding something theres so much software out there,0

yea and python is not good in that area,0
the worst part is they ended 3.5 support.,0
well i keep updating it so..,0
doesnt affect me at all,0
i mean every week there is a new version,0
yea,0
some companies dont update what ppl want,0

@TrueDarkness `while True` and `while not False` do the same things,0
@Deleted User Choose what's more readable and obvious to you.,0
PEP8 recommends the first one which I don't like,0
no `not False` is not faster than `True`,0
Lol what is happening,0
Some test this out xd,0
@LunarEclypse You're missing a `=`.,0
how would `while not False` be faster than `while True`,0
It looks very strange to me. From what I know `while True` the way to go. There's no need to add extra verbosity. It also looks very strange to write `while not True` instead,1
`while 1`,0
Let's not hahha,0
or maybe `while math.pi`,0
why cant i stream?,0
@LunarEclypse It's a normal keyword argument just like `color`,0

"def index(l): k = [] for i in range(len(l)): k[i] = l[i]+i.str() print(k) index([""a foo 3])",0
Hey @michiel!,0
@Urkchar Well `list` must be a string then.,0
"\'\'\'def index(l): k = [] for i in range(len(l)): k[i] = l[i]+i.str() print(k) index([""a foo 3])\'\'\",0
@LightSpdRunner I think best practices still value readability. Language features often serve the purpose of conciseness and readability.,0
@LightSpdRunner It's just that I don't think `break` is always unreadable.,0
Using a language feature for no reason is not inherently good.,0

I agree that single character variable names are rarely a good idea.,0
this should it be,0
Exceptions can be abstract math or iteration variables.,0
sure but when the meaning is well understood why not,0
can you change it because I dont see it?,0
Using l for a list in a small function is borderline for me.,0
dementati its for school and they gave those,0
names,0
Fair enough.,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan Their meaning is wellunderstood in the context of abstract maths or in a loop 🙂,0
> I agree that single character variable names are rarely a good idea.@dementati I always use q to name a queue,1
I think in most cases it would be better to use a name that describes what the queue is for.,0
@Urkchar If you're receiving taat error on that line `line` is not a list. You can print `line` and `type(line)` to see.,1
is there someone realy loves programming in python and wanne make my homework? ;p,0
guys when i code try need to be with expect??,0
i think a good rule of thumb is to scale the verbosity of variable names based on the scope of the variable,1
@michiel we're not going to do your homework for you.,0
@michiel That would be against the rules of this server.,0
No we won't do your homework for you.,0

@fix error :warning: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```[No output]```,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan I can agree with that to some extent. But with the qualification that you should always use the best name possible for a variable. Even if the scope of a variable is small if there's a good name that describes exactly what it is you shouldn't dismiss it in favor of a single character just because it's faster to type.,1
sure i agree with that,0
Loll,0
but that's just excessive,0
@LightSpdRunner That seems unnecessary.,0
Using i for an iteration index is a widely understood convention.,0
So that is a valid exception to the rule.,0
dementati can I ask you private a quick question ?,0
In some cases a singleletter variable describes a variable best as the variable has no particular meaning.,0
@michiel I doubt it's necessary to ask me in private.,0
I will most likely just ask you to use a public channel. But if you insist go ahead.,0
its just all discutions mixed inhere,0
You can open a help channel see #❔｜howtogethelp @michiel,0
@Urkchar That's exactly the same thing. Print out `line` and its type right before the `line[i] = ...` line.,0
@michiel What @fix error said.,0
I know but its a quick question with prob a stupid wrong thing,0
Doesn't matter.,0
You can use help channels for any question big or small.,0

@coldzera How does Board use Player?,0
pip install discord.py,0
anyone?,0
into cmd,0
thanks,0
@coldzera So does Player have a reference to Board? Or is it using a global variable or something?,0
hey guys i have a pretty heavy issue in #helpapple and i know it’s a lot but if anyone wants to help it would be great,1
I mean you could do this:```pyclass Board: # some stuffclass Player: def __init__(self board): self.board = board @abstractmethod def move(self): passclass RandomPlayer(Player): def move(self): # ... self.board.set_position(something) # ...```,1
And then you would do something like:```pyboard = Board()player = RandomPlayer(board)player.move()```,0
It's better for Player to own a reference to Board rather than use global variables.,0
It makes it clearer how the classes relate to each other.,0
Smaller risk of confusing bugs.,0
@marc Not sure I understand your question.,0
@PRETIOSU This is a Python server. If you want help with other languages please use an offtopic channel.,0
@marc It would call the method furthest down the inheritance tree of the object in question.,0
@marc So if you have a RandomPlayer object and the subclass implements the method that would be called. If the subclass has no implementation but there's an implementation in the parent class that would be called.,1
@coldzera Cool glad I could help.,0
```pydef add(a b): return a + b```for example,0
@Emily. You don't put the body of the function inside the brackets. You just list the parameter names there.,0
"```pydef ans1(): a1 = input(""[?]: ) if a1 == 1"": print(""a = 1"")```",0
the latest is 3.9.0 but anything past like 3.6 should be fine,0
> @snax also im only on python 3.8.3 64bit (also dunno if this is the latest version or not)@coldzera 3.8.6 is out as well as 3.9,1

@Kazuki Your question doesn't really make sense. There's no concept of temperature in Python in general.,0
Yeah lol,0
@Kazuki Step size refers to the steps you take between the starting temperature and the end temperature.,0

@Emily. random is not a part of the math module,0
random is its own module,0
@Emily. Show your code,0
You're trying to call random through math,0
random is not a part of the math,0
No,0
@Emily. Are you trying to generate a random integer between 0 and nums  3?,0
@Emily. Three random numbers in what interval?,0
@Slow That will only generate random numbers between 1 and 3,0
They said they want to generate 3 random numbers.,0
@CumSock Yes I believe so.,0
@petr Class methods automatically provide a reference to the class used to call it.,0
So cls is the class Color.,0
Kind of like how regular instance methods provide a reference to the instance of the class used to call it.,0
Like ```pyclass Color: def foo(self): passcolor = Color()color.foo()```,0
Hey @Jamie_!,0
@petr Color() calls the constructor and creates a new instance of Color.,0
Class methods are not tied to a particular instance of the class.,0
So cls is not an instance of Color it's the class itself.,0
You could do this:,0
```pyclass Color: @classmethod def foo(cls): c = cls() # Here I'm creating a new instance of Color return ccolor = Color.foo() # this would be the same as:color = Color()```,1
he is kinda wrong though,0
@snax cls is a reference to the class itself,0
@snax cls is conventional for class methods,0
self only refers to class instances,0
but for class methods the first parameter is not a class instance it's the class itself,0
@snax See my example above where I use cls to call the class constructor and instantiate the class inside the class method.,1
I can only do that because cls is Color not an instance of Color.,0
No worries,0
"@petr Class methods are often used to provide a class with alternate constructors. Since Python does not allow for function overloading it can be a bit messy if you want to be able to construct a class in different ways. Like:```pyclass Foo: def __init__(x=None y=None json_str=None): if json_str: json_obj = json.loads(json_str) self.x = json_obj[""x""] self.y = json_obj[""y""] else: self.x = x self.y = y```",1
are you using the right datatypes?,0
Int64 when you should be using Int8 or something,0
"@petr So here if I wanted to construct Foo with literal parameters I would supply x and y but not json_str and if I wanted to construct it with json I would use the json_str but not x and y and I would need to use named parameters to choose which I want:```pyfoo1 = Foo(x=1 y=2)foo2 = Foo(json_str=\'{""x"":1 y"":2}\')```",1
Owners I would like to partner,0
"@petr A better way would be to use class methods to define two alternate constructors: ```pyclass Foo: @classmethod def from_json(cls json_str): json_obj = json.loads(json_str) return cls(json_obj[""x""] json_obj[""y""]) def __init__(self x y): self.x = x self.y = y```",1
"Now I can create the objects like this:```pyfoo1 = Foo(1 2)foo2 = Foo.from_json(\'{""x"": 1 y"": 2}\')```",0
@petr That should be `ìf json_str:` sorry,0
Great,0
@UltimateChaos That declares the method a class method. A class method can be called without a class instance and the class itself is supplied as the first parameter.,1
They are called decorators in Python.,0
They're called annotations in Java iirc.,0
Or something with the same syntax.,0
They don't work the exact same.,0
But you can use them in a somewhat similar way.,0

@thebouv I get that feeling sometimes sometimes you wann make something then you so lazy to go thtough the fundamentals,0
i need to detect what color is in a area of the screen,0
i dotn want to save the pic too,0
Happened to me once but I was like heck i dont even know what i'm doing  then spent some months learning python,1
@thebouv well yeah but how to do the pixel locating thing,0
like what lib to use,0
I'm glad i took courses on python now i'm in college and it really paid off spending ohours,0

@Davido there's many languages because there's many kinds of tasks and some languages are more suited to certain tasks than others. That's all,1
@Sire Moyale np bro,0
@Infinimata languages like Javascript which is more for web dev now that node.js is avliable you can use it for server side as well,1
I mean both python and C are general purpose language,0
@Davido sure and if people want to use JS for both front and backend they're welcome to.,0

```pythonprint('test')```,0
it's not stupid if you understand what's happening,0
`None` is falsy so when you use `bool` you get False,0
so how is that stupid,0
it's only possible to do `int(False)` because booleans are a subclass of ints,0
no there is no character type,0
sure i agree with that,0
what people call chars is just a string with len = 1,0
does this work? ```pythontest = test'if x not in test:```,0
copy str1 into a new string then copy str2 into the new string,0

@petr The same way you can add integers without knowing how they are implemented.,0

```pythonUnboundLocalError: local variable userinfo referenced before assignment``` what does this mean?,0
Trying to get a window application name rather than pid and process name.,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx you're using a variable before it was created.,0
Thanks @Infinimata,0
Hmm,0
@petr Everything in Python is an object so for example everythin has a pointer to its type and the number of references to that object (the refcount). So yes there are no primitive types in Python.,1
"Here\'s what the code looks like:`import wmi # Initializing the wmi constructorf = wmi.WMI() # Printing the header for the later columnsprint(""pid Process name"") # Iterating through all the running processes for process in f.Win32_Process():  # Displaying the P_ID and P_Name of the process print(f""{process.ProcessId:<10} {process.Name}"") `I\'m getting the process names and PIDs but what I need is the application name.",1

@! xXKiller_BOSSXx which line throws the error?,0

the line ```pyuserinfo = json.loads(userinfo.text)```,0

ye i know,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx that may be creating many problems right there which are going to be hard to debug later.,0
Oh,0
so what do i need to do?,0
@petr Custom objects have a dict with all of their attributes.,0

@fix error :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```{'x': 1 y': 2 z': 3}```,0
define the inner function in the global namespace,0
chop it out of there dedent it.,0
@godlygeek agreed but I think it's worth fixing anyway,0
Hmm but i just need to use that function in the CheckLogin() function,0
i dont need it to use it anywhere else,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx it's still bad style to define it like that. Move it into the global namespace. You're not wasting any resources in any measureable way by doing so,1
Ok,0
anyone know how truth tables work?,0

@Mark,0
not sure what the answer for this is,0
@godlygeek true but I figured it was worth disabusing them of this particular style of doing things anyway,0

"```pythonactivity += time+""\""```",0
because it think \ as a var but it's not @Ghøst™,0
@neoncraxks print(i) Not 20name because for i in name: the \'i\ in the name first item,0
print(i),0
replace print(20name) with print(i),0
what is activity and the time?,0
If is known that a population increases its size by 25% each day in python should I use recursion for creating a function that does the calculation? Or could I just use ```P(t) = P0  e^rtBeing P0 the initial population r the ratio at which it is increasing and t the number of days.e is a mathematical constant but I don't know if I should use it to avoid recursion instead of wasting resources without a clear reason.```Thanks.,1
like what is in the activity and time,0
you don't need recursion for that you can solve it iteratively quite simply,0
Yeah but I mean could I solve it with just a mathematical operation? as shown there using the constant e,0
yeah you could do that too,0
Thank you.,0

@! xXKiller_BOSSXx When you first run PyInstaller on a project it generates a .spec file that's in your projects root directory. With that you can customize future runs of PyInstaller to do things like include imports that it doesn't detect properly.https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/specfiles.htmlThat doc goes into how spec files can be generated reused edited etc. They're the key to making PyInstaller work right.I'd als recommend using PyInstaller without the `onefile` option because otherwise it makes debugging difficult until you get everything running.,1
"```pythonimport PythonDiscord,Minecraftif \'hi\ in PythonDiscord: minecraft.delete(""Account"")```",0
It also helps to compile apps with the console enabled and to run the resulting .exe from the command line so you can see any error output printed to the console. This includes things like potential missing imports or other files that weren't bundled with the app.,1

the one you use in the set function,0
"```pydef set(s): # to work as set,takes a list of words # since set has unique elements there is no need of any filtering set_word = set(s) # returning the set return set_word```this function is entirely useless",1
right,0
the set function is always there you yourself used it in the definition of your own set function,0
@versachai_18 You're trying to call `set` inside `set` which results in infinite recursion. That's the issue.,0
```pydef f(): return f()```,0
actually if you need to preserve order `set` is not the right thing,0
you could do something funny like adding everything to a dictionary as the keys with a random value like 1 or something then loop over the dicts which would give you the keys in the same order but wihtout duplicates maybe,1
that's extremely hacky though and idek if it works,0

@UltimateChaos `islice` doesn't work with negative indices because that would require the argument to have a `len` which is not possible for an arbitrary iterable.But you can write your own version of `islice` if you want to save that nanobit of memory:```pydef islice(iterable start=None stop=None step=None /): if start is None: yield from iterable elif stop is None: if start < 0: start = len(iterable) + start index = 0 for item in iterable: if index >= start: yield item index += 1 elif step is None: yield from islice(iterable start stop 1) else:  if start < 0: start = len(iterable) + start if stop < 0: stop = len(iterable) + stop index = 0 for item in iterable: if start <= index < stop and (index  start) % step == 0: yield item index += 1```okay maybe not a nanobit.

@UltimateChaos ...but assigning to a global function or a singleton is the same thing as using global variables.,0
yep,0
and when you define a function or a class at module scope you define a global variable,0
alrighty,0

but as soon as i converted it to .exe with pyinstaller it stops working,0

@Bast you can put a global variable in a module that way it's isolated,0

@UltimateChaos If you want to get rid of globals at all costs this is an option as well.```pydef make_foo(): answer = 42 def foo(): nonlocal answer answer += 1 print(answer) return foofoo = make_foo()```It doesn't change much but it's technically not a global (same as making a singleton class).,1

no like,0
i think the first one compares `(0 == 0) == true` while the second `true == true`,0

you need to make it so that the time is not this short to supress other variables/overhead@xtremedevx,0

@xtremedevx you could plot it with different amount of iterations then you should start to see linear or other relationships,0

How do we incorporate Vue in Flask like partially only for some async verfication  validation and stuff,0

@sp1000 Feel free to open a help channel. Check out #❔｜howtogethelp,0

Yes it is,0
@Kronos If you're not using `npm` to build your app you can just include Vue in the HTML using a `<script>`.,1
If i am using npm  will i have to do that every single template ?,0
> guys what is this@Hail the Queen! you have to type hello world,0
You need to print Hello World!,0
I don't want it to be an SPA i just want it for achieving some functionalities only,0
@Kronos It can be made easier if all of your templates inherit from a base template. Then you can just include Vue in the base template only.,1
Okay Thanks @eivl | @fix error,0
how can i ignore an error?,0
"@Kronos It\'s not using Vue _or_ Flask but whatever  it\'s the same idea.Example from my repo: <https://github.com/decoratorfactory/pythonblog>I have a `frontend/` directory which is an npm package with a singlepage application. When I change something on the frontend `npm run build` is executed. The compiled files are stored in the `frontend/public/` directory.Then I have a `server/` directory which is a Python package. It runs a Python HTTP server. It serves the frontend as static files:```pyapp.mount(""/ StaticFiles(directory=""frontend/public""))```You can mount Vue onto an existing serverrendered app <https://medium.com/@bluntjackson/addingvuejstoanexistingprojected2d040f870b> but you\'ll have to ditch singlefile components. You can consider switching to an SPA and only using flask to expose certain API endpoints that return plain data.",1

@Deleted User When you get an error there are three ways to deal with it:1) FIx the code so that the error doesn't occur (if the error is a bug)2) _Handle_ the error (acknowledge that an error can occur in a certain place and do something with it)3) _Ignore_ the error (just continue as if it didn't happen)`3)` is rarely the way to go!What you're getting is a _warning_ not an _error_. A warning occurs because the library warns you that you're doing something sloppy but is technically correct.This might be helpful:<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56726381/r2scoreisnotwelldefinedwithlessthantwosamplespythonsklearn><https://scikitlearn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html>,1

Would you guys like to see the code?,0
How do you paste it on here.,0
I am new to some discord stuff still.,0
@DARKDRAGON532 From combinatorics it\'s `number of possible characters` to the power of `string length`. For example a 5character string of a b c can take one of `3  5 = 243` values.That\'s because if you have two values one with `N` possible outcomes and other with `M` possible outcomes the possible outcomes for the tuple `(first second)` is `N  M`:```x: A By: 1 2 3(x y): (A 1) (A 2) (A 3) (B 1) (B 2) (B 3)```,1

Yeah true,0
You are not allowed to use that command here. Please use the #botcommands channel instead.,0

i'm trying to think of a way to increase traffic in the help category in this server,0

Sorry guys for asking a noob question but I had to clarify itSo the question in my exam wasWhich of the following are keywords1.break2.continue3.range4.all of the aboveSo which will be the answer,1
how range can be a keyword,0
> how range can be a keyword@Deleted User it isn't a keyword it's a builtin function,0
yep but my teacher is saying its a keyword lol,0
"try this: `range = hello""` this is allowed",0
its a function actually,0
@Deleted User some people speak imprecisely,0
it would definitely be confusing to reassign range,0
ok thanks for the help lemme clarify the doubt with my teacherThanks for the help again,0
@Theagainmen i was lookig at your code and then you put that distracting gif in my face.....,0

@Theagainmen i don't think you want inheritance don't you just want to create a logger with a certain level?,0

Hi I am trying to read data from the OBD port of a car and display the data on a Flask webpage and keep on getting this error:[obd.elm327] could not open port \\\\.\\\\COM5': PermissionError(13 Access is denied. None 5)But i can read data from the OBD port if Flask is not used and i just run a simpler program. I was wondering if anyone could help,1
@Theagainmen it seems like you've jumped to inheritance as a solution without having a clear idea of the problem you are trying to solve.,1
and we don't know what Manager class you are looking at.,0
> I see.. I will explain my issue a little more maybe I'm looking at the wrong solution.> > I'm using a logger and I have created some functions for it throughout the whole code I use these functions or simply use `log.debug('debug!')`. However now I want to wrap these functions into a class to improve code readability and cleanup my code a little but I still want to be able to use all these functions throughout the code (so also the `log.debug`).@Theagainmen Can you show us some of your code? `log.debug(..)` is already a method on an object. How will your class improve things?,1

@Theagainmen i'm not sure what you are trying to add to logging here. There is probably already a way to do it with logging and if not it looks like a new handler instead of functions like this.,1
Do u do job?,0
@Theagainmen these functions are adding something to logging. You have the idea that when you log you also want to add to this global variable right?,1
You're not understanding me sorry. These functions are trying to add something to logging.,0
@Theagainmen the point of `print_logs` is to be logging plus something else,0
That extra something else could be a logging handler,0
if you want to keep your functions and put them in a class don't use inheritance. Make the class have a logging object as an attribute.,1

Installing Visual Studio seems like a big task to do...,0
@JustOscarJ where did you get that?,0
You don't write functions later the implementation is not done in python,0
no that's not how it works,0
machine code is never generated,0
no but the computer understands the C program running (the actual interpreter),0
the machine code never contains any reference to the python code,0
it's just the VM,0
it's not an extra step,0
it's a different method,0
C is also implemented in C 🙂,0
c also doesn't have accurate stack traces,0
no it's not true,0
yes,0
python source code gets compiled to the python vm bytecode,0
because there are other benefits to interpretation,0
introspection and debugging being the 2 huge ones,0
no that's not correct either,0
aaaa,0
> @JustOscarJ maybe it makes the whole thing complex like C++ you would have to define data types manage memory and stuffreferring to this,1
and most c compilers are written in C++,0
most c compilers are mostly written in C++,0
of course they can,0
yes they can wtf is going on with the disinformation today,0
> c compilers cant be written in c@TheRandom why not?,0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers),0
they are,0
they are,0
can anyone tell me how to get started with pyqt?,0
you are correct tho the very first implementation of a compiled language has to be in a different language,0
but once you have a minimal implementation working you can rewrite it in itself,0
yes by far my favourite subject,0
if there was actually more than 7 jobs worldwide i'd do it,0
> cpython > python@JustOscarJ what do you mean by that?,0
CPython is the moreformal name of the the python implementation almost everyone uses.,0
cpython is python :aa:,0

if u could help me then pls ping me,0
That seems right,0
wdym,0
> do you need to use self? just doing more_stuff() will work right?@sahil04 I don't think so,0
@eivl also why woould I need self to call one method in a class if i am calling it from another method,1

pycharm and other IDEs are quite overwhelming,0

It also adds support for various Python frameworks like Django and Google App Engine etc.,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan Yeah that as well.,0
thats what extensions are for tho,0

can you slice a range?,0
i think so?,0
I'm pretty sure you can't.,0
range is a sequence right?,0
range is an iterator,0
yup slicing works,0
```pythonIn [11]: range(10)[5:]Out[11]: range(5 10)```,0
!e print(range(10)[:6]),0
@✪ SavagePastaMan :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```range(0 6)```,0
huh,0
Oh interesting.,0
I stand corrected.,0
@DarkSnake lists can contain anything,0
it makes a lot of sense actually,0
its very smart too,0
@Guitar what type,0
"if its immutable like int,str,float you can just reassign it",0
> its very smart too@✪ SavagePastaMan what about it sounds so smart?,0
ew globals,0
it uses the fact that it's sorted to do things faster,0
globals are bad,0
any function can modify a global,0
that makes it hard to reason about,0
if you want a constant do it in ALL_CAPS,0
not this again,0
hey can anyone give me a hotels customer form,0
Just do ```pydef func(a):``` and you'll have `a` as a local variable again. Then you can return it as well,0
!global,0
,0
oh we have that,0
Yeppp we have a lot of great tags. Including `globals`,0
`x = 5;y=x` works tho,0
@DarkSnake You can do it but it won't do what you think.,0
global is easy but so is getting addicted to drugs,0
bruh why did you steal my name,0
actually a pretty good analogy,0
@DarkSnake It will create a list with a single element where that element is the range object.,0
@DarkSnake If you want a list with the same sequence as the range you should do list(range()),0
[range()] also works,0
@hmmm True but I think using the list constructor is more readable.,0
true,0

@Deleted User Stop spamming the same thing over and over.,0
they are all fast,0
so it depends on what you want to do,0
@Roey Doron if processing speed is the first priority then C/C++ which can be wrapped in Python for convenience (and is quite often),1
@Roey Doron C++ binaries tend to be significantly faster than interpreted Python programs.,0
C++ is trash,0
just stick with python,0
C++ is pretty hard,0
if you want safety then go with python,0
Ohh,0
You can also use Cython to incrementally translate Python to C for speeding up certain functions,0
else you gotta invest some time in C++,0
if you want safety then go with pythonelse you gotta invest some time in C++,0
but most of the speedups with Python come from using C/C++ libraries that have Python interfaces for convenience,0
I like c++,0
Yws,0
memory leak aint the main issue,0
relying on libraries isn't a bad thing many native C++ programs do exactly that,0
C++ aint safe,0
besides why reinvent the wheel?,0
Like my,0
If you didnt know c++ properly you will have a lot of bugs in your program,0
@RayKxx you'd write a C++ module then use `ctypes` or `swig` or even `cython` to interface with it,0
Ahh,0
Thanks,0
yeah you gotta invest at least 57 years,0
@Roey Doron If you like C++ you might want to check out Rust.,0
if you wanna be productive,0
and write safe code,0
It's good for the same types of applications but it's more modern.,0

but in general you should treat each of your subpackages as opaque modules with a public API,0
so you import from them instead from their submodules,0
helps with encapsulation and gives shorter imports,0
> @gm Would you just import them in the init file in the root package?@UltimateChaos yup,0
okay so for example in my Django project I have a `views` subpackage in each app,0
and everything imports only from that.,0

> WAs wondering if it was the right way@UltimateChaos I don't know if it's the right way but that's what I do,1

I think im missunderstanding something,0
self.zones says unindent does not match outer level,0
error?,0
lol,0
why do you have 2 functions named f,0
lmao,0
and you dont call any function,0
yea guess i didnt need to ask for the error,0
and what does `return i` mean in the second function? im confused here,0
> for a lexer is it better to use numpy arrays or python lists considering the speeds.@VideoCarp numpy arrays are only good if you are doing the same thing to all the elements at once. i don't see how a lexer would fit that.,1

nope just tabs,0
checked it twice,0
,0
I did try with a simpler code after,0
ok I think it might be a vs code bug,0
@Deleted User can you upload the actual file somewhere? (it's not a vscode bug),0
how can i paste my code here in black box for questions,0
ok,0

gebus,0
there I made it much simpler,0
just that return shows indent error,0
@nedbat,0
When using with you don\'t need to close the file Python will do that for you,0
@Deleted User you have a tab before that return.,0
oh with c++ it was good practice,0
or maybe not.,0
no the indent is def fine,0
I edited that bit in discord though to simplify it,0
check if you have spaces and tabs?,0
may have messed it up there. but in vs code its def all tabs,0
@Deleted User this is why we need to get the actual file. Can you upload it somewhere with no editing?,0
oh nvm,0
what was it?,0
the with was indented wrong,0
it was a tab?,0
idk... I back spaced twice and then tabed twice and it fixed it,0
Also I think it is a standard to put self in every method of a class I THINK,0
its susposed to be all tabs,0
this may be considered blasphemy but is it possible to slipstream another python source package into my own package's sdist?,0
@Deleted Userwhy not make it a dependency?,0
@nedbat I have one particular use case where I can't install my package into a separate virtualenv and must use a system python that has everything I need except this package... And I don't want to python install user either.,1
@nedbat as I said it's potentially blasphemous but just curious if it's possible,0
why can't you install this package into the system python?,0
I don't have access to it,0
guess it's not possible,0
it is possible but it could be fiddly,0
welp... that was all a waste anyway since self variables arnt accessible from another file...,0

oh wait...,0
@nedbat https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42859852/distributingmultiplepackagesusingsetuppyforpython,0

I still use setup.py to make the sdist,0
I'll play around with it,0

@Filusso Phee If you were in a REPL (read eval print loop) environment it'll automatically show you the GUI but in regular code you'll need to actually call it,1

We can give some general guidance but no actual solutions,0
@DaemonLorde If you have to check whether a number is divisible by 10 it should probably be an integer.,0
Then you can use the modulo `%` operator to get the modulo of your number and 10.,0
@VideoCarp In most cases  the opposite,0
how can I get my bots member object,0
ctx.memberdoes not work,0
oops wrong channel,0
@Brodweh No a remainder doesn't have to be 0 or 1.,0
@DaemonLorde Do you understand the modulo/remainder operation (in mathematics)?,0
> No a remainder doesn't have to be 0 or 1.`157 % 10 == 7`,0
`x` is divisible by `y` when the remainder of dividing `x` by `y` is 0.,0
?,0
@DaemonLorde yes `%` is the modulo operator. ```py>>> x = 157>>> y = 2>>> x % y1>>> x % 107>>> x % 10 == 0False>>> 150 % 10 == 0True```,1
Yes that's the right idea.,0

Not sure if this’ll help but try upgrading pip,0
ok thx,0
It should work but when it doesn't work for me then I install using git.,0
Maybe just set it up correctly the first time around,0
will check that out thanks. i have never used git for python packages oof. working on it. will drop an update later,1
Ok check that out,0
Ah okay. Ping me when you’ve tried upgrading pip,0
i was able to set it on earlier version of python issues started when i did in 3.9,0
on it,0
Hmm. I thought you were referring to 3.8.6?,0

Ah. I believe it’ll take some time before 3.9 is supported for most packages,0
there might be but not that Ik of,0
You can use Unoffical Python binaries or git lol,0
hola como estas,0
PyAudio have some problem with it,0
hello there and english pls @oak,0

what to do when someone said python is too easy,0
> what to do when someone said python is too easy@Deleted User tell them that they are being arrogant,0
kewl,0
i think #toolsanddevops right?,0
@HungMCGamer install using git or use unoffical python binaries to install it,0
how do u set a variable as constant?,0
oh u don't,0
convention is for constants to be in ALL_CAPS,0
ohh i see,0
You can’t though the naming convention of CAPITALS signal that you want it to never be changed,0
but this is just convention nothing actually preventing it from being changed,0
@HungMCGamer do `pip install pipwin` and then do `pipwin install pyaudio`,0
right so it's just for the people reading the code,0
ye but that's work,0
or instead of downloading some random `pipwin` thing,0
yeah but we don't have something like actual const lol,0
just download a wheel from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/,0

no,0

Hmm not quite sure then (if you’re using 3.8.6). Maybe someone else knows better,0
yeah pastebins are very nice,0

json not file lol,0
Ok lol,0

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯,0
go to program and modify your python check that pip option now you have pip @3Dawi sounds like a bit long but this is better for you in future,1

some times it doesn't because pip option is no checked,0
You can also do pip if you have installed it properly,0

if i call a nonasynchronous function during an event loop is that blocking? or is the function executed outside of the loop's thread?\\,1

Programming language design is difficult,0
Thats small,0
@bee. Simple questions can go here,0
What is your problem?,0
hi anyone know how i can clean this up?,0
@Aboo Minister conceptually it's difficult  when I worked on mine I was up against the wall of my own limited understanding of how languages are designed and compiled and I eventually had to lay off because other things were taking up more of my time and attention. But now that I have a better idea of what's involved I might fare a lot more successfully next time,1
@Aboo Minister Eventually I'd like to get back to it. The hard part is creating the runtime facilities which is a lot of tedium  memory management interfaces to system operations handling of strings and the like,1
@R i s k if that's a discord.py question ask in #discordbots,0
"anyone know how i can clean the output of this up? i have ```name: (username),password: (password)```",0
"```temp={""a"":10,""a"":10,""b"":20,""b"":20,""b"":20}```I want to remove duplicate keys and values output will be:```temp={""a"":10,""b"":20}```",0
@sikari Dictionaries do not have duplicate keys by default,0
"```py>>> a={""a"":1 a"":2}>>> a{\'a\': 2}```",0
if you define a dictionary that way the lastdefined value for any key gets precedence.,0
@bee. you may want to grab a help channel. I don't know enough about what you're doing to help,0
Sup ma slimes,0
Lol,0
```py> print(b a c)```,0
My question on python how do u know if your code works,0
You run it,0
like is there a thing on the side where it shows u what your doing,0
‘’’Print(5 + 3)’’’,0
@Pron how are you running your Python code?,0
no my question is there like a show area where u can see what your code is doing?,0
@Pron that's typically the console output but if you're talking about inspecting the program's state as it runs that's more complex. That can be done with debugging tools or by just inserting `print` statements in your code where you want some state information to be printed to the console,1
Ok thank you,0

I have made code for calculation but how do I store my answer in a list?,0
@Infinimata could you help me a bit?,0
@Deleted User `the_list.append(answer)`,0
@Doctor First idea that comes to my mind is to split the input (taking in count that you receive a string) and then for each element sum it in to a previously defined variable ```pythonmy_array = input('Input your number:\').split('')my_sum = 0for number in my_array: my_sum += int(number)```,1
i just fixed my first script in python and im actually proud of myself,0
@Deleted User I did something like that but it was too slow 🤔,0
@Doctor sounds like the easy way to do that is to have a `while` loop that checks the length of your string to see if it's greater than one and if so sums the digits and returns a new copy of the string to be checked again,1
@Infinimata how to store the ans in a variable then I can append it,0

@Several people the search engine?,0
> @Deleted User What version do you have now and what version do you want?@Aboo Minister i have 3..8.5 i wanna install 3.9 ig thats latest,1
@Infinimata Yeah but again  it was too slowBasically problem was: given numbers A<=10 K<=10^1000Find:Product of K consecutive numbers after ASum of product's digits while it isn't single digitFor example:A = 10 K = 5Product will be 11+12+13+14+15 = 65Sum will be 65>11>`2`,1
Hi! I want to see hidden files ``la ls`` or ``ls la`` isn't working,0
and if i wanna have 3.7 too how do i do it,0
like 2 version of python,0
@Doctor were you using something like `sum(int(digit) for digit in digits)` to get the sum?,0
k,0
ty,0
@Infinimata My current solution is```pyfrom functools import reducedef solve(a: int k: int) > str: product = reduce(lambda x y: x  y range(a a + k)) sum_: str = str(product) while len(sum_) > 1: sum_ = str(sum(int(i) for i in sum_)) return sum_```Probably multiplication takes too long,1

@SimonSanchezArt that's most likely a type hint,0
Hard to tell without seeing code in context though,0
So I tried downloading the comic images from xkcd.com using beautiful soup and now that I've finally downloaded the comic images when I try to open it it says image not supported. what could I have done wrong here?,1
unless the tool you're using actually retrieves annotations and do something with them which would suck badly but it's also a possibility,1
hum yes that's what i said,0
because something is possible doesn't mean it's not a bad idea,0
yeah hard disagree there,0
I don't understand,0
yeah and runtime access to annotations is one nice way to make static type checkers useless,0
yes,0
@SimonSanchezArt in Python it's used by one's linter to ensure that the use of the thing in question is consistent,0
e.g. if you have a function that takes a hinted `str` type it will complain if you call it with an `int` somewhere,1
why does list(list) return a new list instead of returning self,0
no ?,0
Well it makes sense that calling list on a list would return the same list right?,0
@SimonSanchezArt it's hard to tell without knowing more about the program in question but it looks like (as mburszley noted) it's using some kind of class instance with certain properties as its type,1
```pydef foo(x: Optional[str]) > T: x = x or  ...```is perfectly fine,0
`list()` makes a list out of an iterable,0
Why would you want to use list as a copy function,0
```pyimport osimport timewifi_name = \'WLAN\'enable_wifi = \'netsh interface set interface \'+wifi_name+\ enabled\'disable_wifi = \'netsh interface set interface \'+wifi_name+\ disabled\'os.popen(disable_wifi)time.sleep(10)os.popen(enable_wifi)``` why this no work 😭,1
Instead of list.copy()? which is much clear?,0
> list() makes a list out of an iterable@Deleted User,0
I'm aware but shouldn't it return the same list when passed in a list,0
There's already multiple ways to copy lists,0
what if your function takes any iterable as input and returns a list,0
~~how do you know it's the same list~~misread,0
```pyimport osimport timewifi_name = \'WLAN\'enable_wifi = \'netsh interface set interface \'+wifi_name+\ enabled\'disable_wifi = \'netsh interface set interface \'+wifi_name+\ disabled\'os.popen(disable_wifi)time.sleep(10)os.popen(enable_wifi)``` halpp,0
Just seemed logical to return self,0
ping meh,0
```pydef foo(xs: Iterable[T]) > List[T]: ret = list(xs) ret.append(1) return ret```,0
this would modify `xs` if it is a list,0
well thats a good example thankyou,0
you can force type checking with a flag assuming you're using something like mypy @Bast,0
Also isnt that type hinting wrong?,0
which part ?,0
The return,0
apart that it shouldn't be T but int,0
shouldnt it be union(T and int),0
unless T is constrained on int,0
```pydef foo(xs: Iterable[T]) > Union[List[T] int]: ret = list(xs) ret.append(1) return ret```Im still learning type hinting but is this correct?,0
`List[Union[T int]]`,0

Ohh I kinda get that,0
Relying completely on autocompletitions is bad too,0
Infact I'd suggest sticking to the default when starting out,0
Its definitely what you will be doing most of the time but relying completely on autocompletes and your editor spitting out errors and assisting you that way isnt something I like,1
guys Im looking for a modern gui framework for python can anyone tell me any,0
it's not good to blindly listen to what your editor says though,0

How can I check something like this?`if not Hello or not Bye` or `if not Hello or if not Bye` or how?,1

and if I replace `or` by `and` is the same thing I'm right?,0
@Deleted User no `or` and `and` are not remotely the same,0
oof,0
no I know that but I mean the way to code,0
I can do `if not Hello or not Bye` and also `if not Hello and not Bye`,0
"@Deleted User if you want to test quickly for whether or not something is in a range of possible answers there's an easier way: `if response in ('hello','bye'):`",1
no?,0
@Infinimata thanks but I prefer my way xd,0
@Deleted User those two don't do the same things at all and I don't think they will do what you intend in the first place,1
@Infinimata I want to check if all my lists are empty,0
unless `Hello` and `Bye` are variables,0
aha OK,0
another way you could do it: `not any`,0
I think my way is fine no?,0
"```py>>> a=[]>>> b=[]>>> not any((a,b))True```",0
not any?,0
that returns `True` as long as all of those lists are empty,0
hmm,0
we might have a really dumb answer! :D,0
just kidding go ahead,0
ah OK.,0
so if I do `if not any ((list1 list2 list3 list4))` while those Lists are empty it will return True but in the case that is one of those lists are not empty it will return False I'm right?,1
"@Deleted User ```py>>> a=[]>>> b=[]>>> any((a,b))False>>> not any((a,b))True>>> b=[1]>>> not any((a,b))False```",0
(ignore the first `any` that's just to establish how it works),0

oh yeah not == i forgot,0
if you say `==` then it won't work for anything except another list with the same elements which is not what you want,1
wait it stills says the else function.. i tested it,0
@snax did elif still not working.,0
@snax yeah thats what i want to do.,0
Anyone know how to convert code from VB.net to Python by any chance#,0
nope not at all. sorry,0

@basic_molasses thats waht i did,0

also thats a terrible usecase for classes,0
what should i use calsses for then?,0
actually storing data,0

wait what,0
LOL,0
wait wait wait,0
@PHKDX you solved the problem,0
yeah that,0
i think i fixed it it wotrks now. idk what i did but i removed the classes,0
Sorry about the misleading typo gang,0
i removed the class thging and just made it a function,0
lol I thought it will throw an error if there wasn't a comma,0
it just throws them together,0

its find,0
we all are learning 😄,0
bruh why did python have to inherit that stupid C feature,0
guts i think it was because i made it a class and used self..,0
do you guys think thats why? because when i removed self and stuff it worked,0
yes because thats not what you use classes for,0
oh ok,0
also there was a missing comma,0
you're using a class when you only needed a function,0

no,0
well actually self bot for what,0
i mean if it's not a discord self bot then it's not against their tos,0
just tryna figure how to get a bot to send a mesage to a chat,0
yeah you can't do that,0
based off my input,0
currentsongdata is a json,0
you need to use a bot account,0
did you deserialize it @! xXKiller_BOSSXx,0
i loaded that data them i used currentsongdata['duration'] which is a int,0
yes. Doesnt matter though ig,0
`'duration'` is a string,0
,0
how are you accessing the json in your program,0
```pycurrentsongdata = requests.get('http://localhost:9863/query/track').text currentsongdata = json.loads(currentsongdata)```,0
O(1) @Urkchar,0
that's how i use the json,0
actually it doesn't,0
unless by lookup you mean search by value,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx the `text` attribute is a string no?,0
wait yeah it is a str,0
so use .content?,0
python's dictionaries are not that dumb so it's safe to say they are O(1),0
i think you want `.json` @! xXKiller_BOSSXx,0
so requests.get('http://localhost:9863/query/track').json,0
im assuming `users` should be an array?,0
if so yes its definitely parsable,0
127.0.0.1?,0

@Ty505 You can make alot ofthings if your a beginer for python and want to make games use pygame and if you want to make an app i recomend tkinter,1
@Ty505 Most programming languages have a theoretical property called Turing completeness which means that they are all able to write the same programs functionally speaking. So since Python is Turing complete you can write all the same programs with it that you can with any other language.,1

> Great to know @dementati  I do have experience with HTML CSS and a bit of Javascript. Perhaps that may help with transitioning to something like Python?@Ty505 well you can use those languages to make websites you can use moduals like flask and django to make websites,1
@Ty505 Going back to Turing completeness out of JS HTML and CSS JS is the only Turing complete language.,0
So it\'s the only real programming language.,0
yeah but you have to download node.js to use it off the web,0
Right. What people usually mean when they say programming language is a Turingcomplete language.,0
They are formal languages.,0
Just not programming languages.,0
im going to make my app dm me if you have questions,0
to be fair there is a whole portion of what many people would call programming language that aren\'t turing complete,0
in fact these languages have non turingcompleteness as a feature,0

Python is good for web service backends.,0
PHP or Python for backend? What do you need to take into account?,0
@Deleted User Not much to be honest. They are both viable options with similar features. People seem to generally prefer Python to PHP as a matter of subjective preference.,1
There might be a better library ecosystem for Python.,0
I don't have any personal experience with PHP professionally but it seems to me like it's on its way out.,0
5 years or 10 or 15 I don't know about.,0
You can get by that way but you might as well just learn the fundamentals. I think you'll save yourself a lot of time and effort that way.,1
@dementati html/css is turing complete,0
some guy made rule 110 in html/css,0
@hmmm HTML5 + CSS3 apparently is in some esoteric way. Things often accidentally become Turing complete. But it's still pretty misleading to call them programming languages. They probably aren't Turing complete on their own.,1

turing complete means it can simulate a turing machine,0
im just going to copy paste wikipedia here```The Turing machine mathematically models a machine that mechanically operates on a tape. On this tape are symbols which the machine can read and write one at a time using a tape head. Operation is fully determined by a finite set of elementary instructions such as in state 42 if the symbol seen is 0 write a 1; if the symbol seen is 1 change into state 17; in state 17 if the symbol seen is 0 write a 1 and change to state 6; etc.```,1

@lgneous They probably meant any computable problem.,0
@Urkchar,0
yes they did but the distinction is important,0
yeah because coeffs is a method on sympy.Poly(?),0
because it doesn't,0
there's also lambda calculus if you want an alternative to turing machines and arguably simpler,0
its sympy.Poly.coeffs,0

Take 15 seconds and look at your code,0
@Daniel Ehtemam try to go over the spelling,0
reading error messages is extremely important,0
@Daniel Ehtemam here's a hint: the name you gave your function and the name you're using to call it are not quite the same,1
The assignment was sadly using camelCase so I assume that’s what he’ll have to use in this case :/,0
and then making inferences about what the cause of the error is is also very important,0
```len(lst1) == 0 == len(lst2)``` you can do this for the first if statement right?,0
why tho,0
that looks uglier than using 2 seperate ==s,0
saves characters,0
its not codegolf lmao,0
❤️ pandas,0

@binaya that's because that comprehension only includes elements where the length is more than 1,0

a function call does a lot more work than an if.,0

conceptually a function call does more than an if. I;m not sure in what language the call would be faster.,0
but the function being called would need to do a check of some kind. The if has to happen somewhere.,0
we should move the exponentiation out of the whilecondition,0

@VideoCarp have you done any profiling to see where the program is spending most of its time?,0
@VideoCarp O(N2) is about how your code slows down as the data it processes gets larger.,0
there's `cProfile` as an include and a number of other profilers,0
I've also sometimes just used simple timers to see how long a particular function took but `cProfile` is a good place to start to get the big picture,1

yes,0
will it ?,0
huh?,0
you can return a tuple but it\'s still one thing,0

i don't get what u mean by one value though,0
ofc,0
well we can have a argument as a function,0
like```pydef hello(ok): ok()```,0
right so basically a decorater modifies your function?,0

If you're looking to get into hardware I'd recommend looking at microcontrollers,0
@Chibli sorry for the ping but your explanation really made sense thx!,0
If you ever need help with microcontrollers we also have #microcontrollers,0
@Ghost317 i think it's a good place to start. Also obligatory plug for the Adafruit server. They have a lot of great resources to get started,1
@Vestergurkan never knew that channel even existed lol,0
or better wording would be didn't pay attention that's why didn't know it existed,0
Raspberry\xa0Pis are good for server stuff.,0
I quite like Rapberry PIs. They’re nice,0
There is micropython but typically on microcontrollers you're memory constrained where python isn't suitable,0
I have one for my Discord bot or for other server stuff.,0
Most of the time it's just idling though.,0
<https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>,0
We have help channels in case you might need help,0
what is the invite code for the the official discord api discord server? googling it confuses google,0
how can u acess the arguments of a function?,0
@Pratt you can look at the scipy docs. Looking at them now a mode of L indicates the image will be 8bit and black and white,1
But `imread` is a Pillow/PIL functionality so you can also check the Pillow docs,0

ok,0
So I’ve recently learned about while loops and for loops and I’m kinda curious as to when you would want to use one over the other?,1
@eivl online code challenge,0
@Deleted User `while` loops continue indefinitely until some condition is true (or false). `for` loops iterate through the objects in a collection like a list or a generator,1
Ooooooo,0
Ok that’s makes so much more sense. Thanks @eivl,0
@Infinimata do you know why my code isn't running?,0
@Deleted User do you get an error?,0
> @MertvsGame online coding in python? like a game?@eivl yea,0
shortest code or who write fast wins,0
codingame,0
> @Deleted User do you get an error?@Infinimata no errors my .py file executes correctly but not that peace of code .__.,1
@Deleted User well one thing to keep in mind is that `zip` will stop running when any of the items in it is exhausted. So if any of those items it's iterating through is empty it will stop immediately,1
You may want to `print` the contents of those things before you enter the `for` loop and see if they are what you think they are,1
ah,0
@snax right but sometimes `print` is just the fastest way to get a simple answer,0
> Clash of code @MertvsGame ?@sahil04 yep,0
@snax `pdb` is powerful but one problem at a time,0
Ah ok I’ll keep that in mind thanks @snax,0
> @Deleted User well one thing to keep in mind is that `zip` will stop running when any of the items in it is exhausted. So if any of those items it's iterating through is empty it will stop immediately@Infinimata So is there a way to do what I want even if one or more lists are empty?,1

@Spoon again you don't define `total` on any line before that,0
https://pastebin.com/AKiuLPA8 I got an error trying to install this pakage and I don't understand the output.,0
@Spoon think about this: you're printing `total` but you don't actually say anywhere what it is. Where are you calculating a total for something before that?,1
Could someone help me add vsc to path,0
like i can't use the `code` command in terminal,0
@Spoon you're figuring `total` at the end but you need to have it figured earlier because otherwise you're referring to it before it ever exists,1
thankyou @eivl,0
why is that?,0
ohh,0
i see isn't there another way?,0
cause if i mess up.,0
it's mac,0
@eivl would u mind comming down to #toolsanddevops,0
@SaaU Nare Dictionaries store values by way of a key (typically a string or a number). You use them when you want to refer to a collection of things by names.,1
:),0
Tuples are just lists that cannot be changed,0
Can I ask a pretty basic question that I just can't figure out?,0
@Specimen J ask away,0
"@SaaU Nare what do you mean by streams""?",0
"Print(""you"")",0
So I'm trying to the phrase thing to work and it keeps saying print(phrase) then whatever the phrase is but it's not working,1
@Specimen J post some code?,0
Ya lemme get it real quick,0

@好ま誠 then you'll need to learn how to use an editor and Git,0
Phrase = pog lmaoPrint(phrase),0
That's the whole thinf,0
> Phrase = pog lmao> Print(phrase)Invalid Syntax,0
Oh ok thanks,0
"@Specimen J in your first line you\'re trying to set `Phrase` to something that\'s essentially another variable. You want to use `Phrase=""pog""` to set `Phrase` to the string `""pog""`",1
Ok that makes way more sense,0
It was tryna correct me to def phrase and stuff idk yet,0
```pyimport pygamewhile True: pygame.display.set_mode()```,0
@好ま誠 It's a program that lets you write and run Python code. I think you might want to learn the basics of working with such things before trying to work with GitHub code,1
@Goat Man with a set every element must be unique to the set. They're basically dictionaries with keys only no values. Lists can contain duplicates. Also lists are ordered sets are unordered,1
@好ま誠 python.swaroopch.com this is a link to a good introduction to Python that we recommend often which also includes some instructions on setting up a basic editor,1
@vortex not bad but for the next level up have your program scramble the words itself,0

nvm i can the timer,0
@好ま誠 we can point you at the resources you'd need to get started but the bulk of it is up to you.,1
huh translate should take an arg,0
is anyone here good with matplotlib,0
@Deleted User ask in #datascienceandai,0
@好ま誠 who were you responding to?,0
yes,0
what do you mean @Zail(),0
ive never seen that method anywhere,0
its probably part of a module,0

i see,0
!resources,0
,0
what it says ? @S6F,0
@S6F Have you tried adding to PATH?,0
you must check the pip option while installing and add python to path,0
Or what I should have asked is: are you on Windows or Linux,0
For window pip,0
for linux and macos pip3 think so,0
not in the python repl in a command line/terminal,0
Yes lol,0
@snax oh sorry! I stand corrected :/,0
@S6F 1) I'd recommend 3.8 for now,0
@S6F 2) try `py m pip` instead of just `pip`,0
No,0
Yeah for a few things.,0
@dhzdhd Not every 3rd part library supports 3.9 yet,0
But 3.8 has better support,0
pretty much everything has support for 3.8,0
yes,0
And not everything supports 3.9,0
@S6F didn\'t work is not enough information. what error if any?,0
@S6F you need to run `pip` from the system command line not from within Python.,0
@S6F yes,0

@Dreamy post your questions here,0
@Mitch how are you counting uptime?,0
ok,0
I started python yesterday and I need help with this,0
@Dreamy we don't give generic help with homework. ask specific questions about specific things,0
Oh nvm then,0
@Mitch again how are you counting uptime in that file?,0
@Mitch that's an extremely inefficient way to do it. Record the time once when you program starts and then whenever you get a request for uptime just record the current time and subtract the difference. Don't use counting loops.,1
`time.sleep` is blocking it stops execution of your entire program,0
im trying to do a snake game in pyglet but dont know where to start. I have everything imported but i am litteraly clueless,1
@Kingdom of Merca ask for help in #gamedevelopment  it's the more appropriate channel,0
why would u ever use `time.sleep` when u can use `asyncio.sleep`,0
so you can block,0
and if you don't need async why use async,0
@Mitch like I said: just record time once when you start save that in some global structure and then whenever you need to report uptime record it again and get the difference between the two,1
`==`?,0
@sahil04 there is almost certainly a more efficient way to do this. how are you generating these massive lists?,0
@sahil04 don't use lists for something like that. Use numpy arrays,0
@sahil04 I'm saying you want to rethink how you have those data structures represented entirely if you're doing those kind of comparisons routinely,1
@sahil04 if you convert coordinates to say tuples then you can compare two lists,0
you probably want np for arrays as big as this or come up with a better method,0
Lists are OK if what you have cannot be represented as anything other than complex objects but for things like bitmaps use np,1
@sahil04 no,0
@sahil04 Those 2 lists contain objects (class instances)?,0
@sahil04 could you occupy help channel?,0
@sahil04 so?,0
what to do when im done with python tutorial for begginers?,0
PyCharm gets my vote,0
> any idea why i was able to modify this tuple as desired yet got a traceback anyway?@starcat you modified a mutable object inside the tuple,1
the tuple itself is immutable but mutable objects within can still be modified,0
oh i see what happened too you used +=... which creates a new list... uhh not sure why it allowed the modification like that that's kinda odd... .append() should work without error though,1
yeah i see that now but then why the error?,0
.append() works fine tho which also just mutates the original list,0
an interesting distinction between += and append/extend. appreciate it Numerlor,0
Hello,0
sounds like += mutates and then attempts to assign the latter part being the issue. expanded it would be tup[2] = tup[2] + [4] so the right side evaluates and takes place which mutates the list... then when it come stime to assign tup[2] back to the same object it errors @starcat,1
@EloV But that makes no sense? The right side alone doesn't mutate anything does it?,0
`x[index] += y` is the same as:`x[index] = x[index].__iadd__(y)`,0
but anyway `+=` always assigns to the lefthand side in the end,0
For lists `x += y` behaves differently than `x = x + y`  the first variant mutates the list,0
you can do `student_tuple[2].append(40)` or `student_tuple[2].extend([40 50 60])`,0
> > For lists `x += y` behaves differently than `x = x + y`  the first variant mutates the list> @fix error yeah saw that when i was playing around with it i didn't expect them to behave differently,1
well not everything in Python is perfect and working as expected 🙂,0
@yourmomfat if a vowel is uppercase you add gG,0
also translating long strings will take quite a while you should instead append to a list and join at the end,1
```py111 = 28start = input( )current = startstart  startprint(current)```does anyone know why this is erroring around the start  start,0

HHe's not using string interpolation though?,0
@Deleted User What exactly isn't working?,0
im just trying to add 1 to week number and current to profit but,0
```pyweeknumb + 1profit + current```,0
You need to assign this back to the variables,0
```pyweeknumb = weeknumb + 1profit = profit + current```,0
ohhhh thanks,0
Or even better```pyweeknumb += 1profit += current```,0
yeah my brains not working right now thanks,0
,0
i can add code blocks if easier but im not sure why its doing this im just trying to get it to loop for example it goesweek 1 ...week 2 ...,1
@Deleted User if you know exactly how many times you want to repeat a code block then you can use for loop:```pyfor i in range(5): print(i)```will print 0 1 2 3 4,1
can u merge decoraters?,0
if so how?,0
@Inheritance ♦ wdym>,0
merge,0

"didnt really do what i wanted ```pyACB = 28weeknumb = 0profit = 0start = int(input(""PRICE ))for i in range(5):  ABC = 28  10 current = ABC  start weeknumb = weeknumb + 1 profit = profit + currentprint(""week: weeknumb profit: profit)```this is what i have i did have a while loop before but what i want it to output is```pyweek 1 profit 80week 2 profit 160etc...```",1
you would need to do that in the decorater?,0
ohh i think i might know,0
> @Inheritance ♦ instead of something like `a(b(c(d(n))))` you'd have `(a @ b @ c @ d)(n)`@Stelercus is n the function that is being decorated?,1
ohhh that's whatI was searching for,0
@lakmatiol thankyou,0
@Inheritance ♦ what do you want to do? Maybe there's better way,0
i want to make the decoraters into one line lol @Doctor,0

@coronado03 try this: from the command line type `py` (enter)and then in the prompt that comes up `import gtts`,0

Hey @Deleted User!,0

@Deleted User read it,0
Best solution is to downgrade to 3.8 until more libraries release 3.9 binary support,0

@coronado03 oh you're using Python 3.9. that might have something to do with it.,0

> @coronado03 oh you're using Python 3.9. that might have something to do with it.@Infinimata Oh how so,0
@coronado03 not all modules support 3.9 yet.,0
@Ajay 42,0
Oh should I downgrade?,0
@coronado03 I'd recommend it,0
> @coronado03 just dont delete 3.9 i mean just change your interpreter@vinam Oh how?,0
I don't see why a beginner would need 3.9 to begin with.,0
> what ide are you using? or text editor?@vinam Im using Visual Studio Code,0
No,0
What's the reason to use 3.9 over 3.8 for beginners?,0
Imagine learning about every new feature of the Python interpreter and every method as a beginner when you won't probably need them.,1
> @coronado03 ok so go to the bottom left of your vscode do you see your python version written there?@vinam It was in 3.8 and i changed it to 3.9 and it seems to be working now.,1
we're seeing many examples of newcomers downloading 3.9 and being unnecessarily frustrated because modules in the tutorial they've been provided do not work,1
@Deleted User imagine reading patch notes as a beginner. You would probably just read some articles/watch some videos about python in general or some topics you're interested in,1
boo,0
@vinam I think they had the Microsoft App Store version of 3.8 installed in the background which is why it didn't show up in `py 0p`,1
I'm not even gonna argue with you i'm not feeling like you're worth my time with that kind of thinking...,0
@Moogs if i want say DRAW A GRAPH i don't want to implement it myself. Especially as a beginner,0

"```pydef main():... counter = 0... while True:... print(math.inf  counter)... counter += 1... print(f""Counter is {counter}"")... try:... int(math.inf)... break... except: continue```",0
😎,0
why,0
I am going to subtract from infinity 😎,0
@Moogs changes in 3.9 aren't that significant,0
You can learn python with say v 3.6,0
Haven't you ever wondered what infinity is >:)?,0
I was curious.. cause like in js it's that really nice number that i can't rmr...,0
but with python... it's just... inf,0
and you can't convert it to an int or anything 🤷🏿\u200d♂️,0
@UltimateChaos dicts,0
But I am interested to see what happens when I subtract from it... I'm curious as to at what point it will be able to become a number...,1
I wonder... will it ever be able to become a number 🤔,0
it's at 190k and still going,0
> Turtle would definitively be one that coule help a lot eh@Moogs TURTLE!!,0
?,0
aww... so will inf always be inf?,0
what's also interesting is inf  inf = inf,0
Hey @maks_ustuyanov!,0
But that's what i'm confused about...i thought that computers couldn't handle infinity,0
they don't,0
it's a special case of floats,0
so that's why I thought that it will become a number eventually,0
it's still encoded in 16/32/64 bits,0
,0
> Python just (roughly) follows the floating point arithmetic spec@Numerlor roughly ? any point in mind where it doesn't follow ieee 754 ?,1
legit curious,0
yes,0
but it may or may not be as thin as we think idk,0
hence why i'm curious,0
wait until you learn about countable infinity @vinam,0
what is .imag?,0
the imaginary component of a complex number @Isaiah The Greatest,0
so will it be 0.0 always?,0
or is it only like that for inf?,0
no it's whatever the number's imaginary component is,0
your quotes...,0
@S6F Check out the `colorama` PyPi page it shows you how to use the module.,0
`print((3+4j).imag)` prints 4,0
all give me 0.0 :(,0
it'd be very curious if that was the case numerlor,0
and it only works with floats 🤔,0

Guys i need to choose between django or flask for a projecti have worked with flask on a couple of projects but i have not touched django yetthe project is a real time examination system with AI proctoring i'd count that as pretty big projectwhat'd you guys think should i go with django or flask,1
@mudkip why not?,0
well hastebin is atrocious imo,0
Depends do you want batteries included or do you want to add functionality as you need it?,0
it does it's a wrapper around the interpreter,0
@snax i just don't want the web framwork to be a bottleneck during web development,0
as long as it's set to 3.6+ it works,0
he probably wasn't using 3.6 within idle,0
@Harsha if you just want stuff that works together go with django. If you want to be selective about what you're adding and want it to be a bit lighterweight go with flask.,1
@kutiekatj9 i just don't want it to bottleneck any part of my devlopment i don't care about batteires included or excluded,1
nan is Not a Number but it's of type float... and it doesn't exist 🤔 only way to get it is to do inf /  inf 🤔,1
I mean it depends on what your development looks like. You have to look at what both offer and make the decision based on your circumstances.,1
@mudkip an exam web app with anticheat features,0
"@Isaiah The Greatest `float(""nan"")` works too",0
it's specified in the ieee 754 spec as well,0
I mean like... why when i do type(nan) it says it isn't define?,0
you can toggle flags to have division by 0 return nan tho idek if that's possible in pure python,0
in what way ?,0
under or overflow ?,0
overflows should return []inf,0
When should I start using classes in my scripts?,0
@Urkchar what does your import statement look like?,0
underflows just return a wrong number due to inaccuracies but again you can set flags to get the behaviour you want,1
at least in C[++],0
Im writing code to create sql query objects from a folder so I could create a class with a folder and a query,1
i would like to find the 4x4 transformation matrix that best fits one 3d set of points to another 3d set of points,1

feexcept whatever,0
@zenithlight ask in #datascienceandai I think,0
ohh ok thx,0
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cfenv/fetestexcept/,0
maybe there's a way to do that in python too,0
@Urkchar did you install Pillow or PIL? Also at any point did you assign anything to PIL? Like `PIL = something`?,1
@ζ͜͡λIPowerส็ unsplash.com they even have an API I think,0
Anyone on how they first started incorporating class constructs in their code?,0
Lmao,0
I'm a financial analyst so that wont happen anytime soon,0
just went into it directly classes are a core concept there's no way around it,0
I mean should I just use them as frequently as possible,0
python is not suited for FP,0
Yeah that's why it's confusing as a one person team,0
Pillow is a fork of PIL that is actively developed. Would you be able to share more of your code? @Urkchar,1
it supports some construct it's not idiomatic to force nor is it efficient in any way,0
Well it is if you're doing simple stuff,0
Hfp?,0
Can anyone dm me how to check to see if the person who typed the discord bot command if they messaged,1
that's not true tho,0
Note that `time.sleep` will cause your entire program to suspend execution at that point so you can't do other things while waiting. That's more complex,1
What's hfp?,0
most of them are very object oriented heavy and/or imperative,0
which one,0
that's the dsp stuff right,0
so like `asyncio.sleep(5)`,0
@Urkchar Image is a module within PIL/Pillow so you specifically need to do `import PIL.Image` in your import statement,0
I think you're mixing imperative and functional here,0
not using classes != functional,0
@Slow I would love to use the caculator,0
functional programming is a set of techniques used to encourage the usage of higher order functions like using `map`/`reduce`/`filter` instead of loops passing functions as arguments and returning them etc,1
@BigMac ask in #datascienceandai,0
it's not mutually exclusive to oop,0

hmm,0
Well im trying to see if the person who sent the command input if they messaged again,0
then I want to get that message and use it,0
It doesnt get the latest message from the command author,0
Yes,0
yes i tried check=checck,0
`check=check`,0
@Urkchar Not necessarily usually people do `from PIL import Image`. It depends on how the package and it's modules are setup,1

@AstroBoy9000 the `PATH` is a list of directories on one's system that are searched when you type a command. This way you can add directories that contain things like the Python executable so it launches when you type `python`,1
@AstroBoy9000 that's a URL to something that is running on your own system at some port,0
ok thank you soooo much for hte help,0
Hmm after i added it still shows,0
@Spacecraft1013 ask in #careerdiscussion,0

How could I create a clone of video streaming service (such as Twitch) using Django?,0

Hey @spoon!,0
Twitch also does have chat,0
I will start with that sure,0
But I would want video streaming too,0
I guess the concept is same (sockets/websockets),0
@Deleted User A messaging app will probably teach you a lot. I haven’t really worked that much with video but it’s made of so much more data. Messages are just a lot simpler,1

so when i delete a line it shows that idk why,0
ye,0
to show you deleted a line lol,0
it just looked odd,0
?? deleted line should also be the same as the green line but in red lol,0
@Aboo Minister my first recommendation is don't catch exceptions just to print the exception. It hides the stack trace.,0
wait i can print the errors?,0
You shouldn't catch the exception let Python print it.,0
noo u need try and except to get the errors i think only if you know that error will happen,0
@Aboo Minister you are getting that None error because your parse function doesn't do anything: https://github.com/AbooMinister25/ToyLang/blob/master/lite/main_parser.py#L72,0
so how do i print the except?,0
like the errors,0
```py @self.pg.production('expression : IF expression COMPARISON expression') def if_statement(p): If()```I just noticed this function returns nothing,0
@Aboo Minister look at the line I linked. It's the end of the `parse()` function. there's no return (and no code for it to run),1
yeah `parse` has all these definitions in them which never become part of your `Parser` class,0
@Aboo Minister then Infinimata is probably right: try putting a return on the If() call,0
see the function I quoted; make it `return If()`,0
Dm me if you Wanna help And make a Bot with py with me and more,0
@Aboo Minister i was confused: you define a `Parser.parse` method but that's not what you are calling with `parser.parse` on line 20. You might want to give that method a different name.,1
this function doesn't parse anything but it's called parse: https://github.com/AbooMinister25/ToyLang/blob/master/lite/main_parser.py#L17L71,0

!sm s #pythongeneral 2s,0
✅ The slowmode delay for #pythongeneral is now 2 seconds.,0
...what you can do is return the connection,0
first is your `conec` function is supposed to return something that you use as the connection. It doesn't do this,0
when you invoke it you need to assign what it returns to a local variable that you can reuse.,0
!e```pydef f(): return 42y = f()print(y)```,0

Not bad myself thanks for asking @MarkRems,0

`the_list.insert(position item)` also works,0
Aboo's method replaces an existing item. `insert` adds a new one and pushes all the others forward,0
note that the longer the list the more time it'll take to push items forward,0
although that won't manifest in a noticeable way unless you're dealing with really big lists or doing it in tight loops,1
they basically mean returning a value that you assign to a name so it can be reused,0
"```pyx = int(""5"")# do something else with x ....```",0
exactly that's the whole point,0
@ζ͜͡λIPowerส็ what kind of animation?,0
in order to do animations you need to have some kind of GUI.,0
@Tubbus no. `print` just sends text to the console regardless of whatever else is going on.,0
`print` itself returns nothing. (This is a common pitfall people encounter early on),0
right `None` (all functions return `None` if they have no explicit return),0
the same applies to what you say. `return` and `print` serve entirely different functions,0
"!e print(print(""hey""))",0
@✪ SavagePastaMan :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```001 | hey002 | None```,0
"^ prints the return value of `print(""hey"")`",0
Sure,0
@Tubbus the function's calling itself,0
each parameter passed to it is itself a call to `func`,0
call = invoke a function and get a value in return,0
@Ethereal are you doing any kind of systematic study of the language yet?,0

Is it worth making flashcards for information presented in Python courses,0
@Deleted User do you find flashcards useful?,0
Probably just code,0
For memorizing information I do think so. But I am not sure what the extent of Python is memorization/practice,0
pretty much no memorization and lots of practice,0
Yeah coding is mostly practice very little memorisation,0
if your teacher is telling you to mem the builtins or something then sure,0
that's stupid though,0
Thanks i'll skip the flashcards then.,0
@nosvemosenotragente! ```pydef f(): x = 1 y = 2f()print(x y)```Do you understand why this code fails?,0
```pyimport sysprint (sys.argv)``````PS C:\\Users\\Genji\\Desktop> py main.py 1 2 3 4 5['main.py 1 2 3 4 5']```,0
@CodeKitten,0
!resources @mori we have several!,0
,0
@nosvemosenotragente! When you define a variable inside a function it's a local variable  it only exists _inside_ the function.Just like in maths: if you define a function `f`:```hsf(x) = x + 3y = f(6)  y = 9z = f(5)  y = 8````x` does not make sense outside of `f` (you can't say that `x` has some value). Moreover different functions can have variables with the same name:```hsf(x) = x + 3g(x) = x  4```In Python it's the same. If you want to use some value outside of a function you need to return it```pydef f(x): return x + 3def g(x): return x  4```,1
yes that link,0
if you want guides yeah. there are also videos and courses,0
So you can do: @nosvemosenotragente! ```pydef connect(): db = mysql.connect(...) return db###db = connect()```,0

@DEATHTAKERPRO we just said we're not helping you with what are obviously homework questions.,0
"`[[1.2.1] [3,4,2]].append([1,2,3])` @Escalus",0
Right well you can do ```pynested = [[1 2] [3 4]]lst = [1 2]for x l in zip(lst nested): l.append(x)```,0
you came up with your own MC questions?,0
wait wdym what type of iteration,0
its a loop,0
@DEATHTAKERPRO You're obviously just pasting questions from your test.,0
a while loop ithink,0
> can some give me a slight explnation on this?@neoncraxks it wants you to find the factors of a number,0
@Escalus zip will pair up the elements from the input list with each nested list,0
So the first element from lst will be paired up with the first nested list,0
!e ```pynested = [[1 2] [3 4]]lst = [1 2]for x l in zip(lst nested): l.append(x)print(nested)```,0
@dementati :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```[[1 2 1] [3 4 2]]```,0
wati but what type of iteration is a while loop?,0
That's like the textbook example list comprehension lol,0
@Feroz dropping full solutions to a problem isn't really helpful though,0
Oh good point,0
"https://teachcomputerscience.com/iterations/#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20types%20of,take%20place%20is%20already%20known.",0
I stand corrected,0
wait i found this never know about these lol,0
@Stelercus The textbook example should of course utilize all the features of a comprehension,0
!paste,0
,0
strings in python aren't arrays of chars like in C and there actually isn't a char datatype,0
that's why you never run code without reading it first,0
String objects i bebiebe,0
boxed,0
@Higgs Strings are a builtin type in Python.,0
numbers (ints) are also immutable,0
to a string? @NoNameJr245,0
concatenation creates a new string that's why it's bad practice to use `+=` in a loop (usually),0
@Higgs It would normally only matter for performance and even then only in very particular circumstances.,0
@Escalus Good to hear.,0
@Interlink broad range of applications: web backend scripting/utilities math/science/machine learning,0
@Interlink Python is most widely used for web backend development and data science/machine learning applications.,0
is it possible to inside a define calls inself?,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx functions can call themselves yes.,0
like ```pythondef test(): test()```,0
like that,0
that work?,0
@LaTsukai it's not the memory that's the problem. concatenating a new string requires (essentially). 1. allocate space for a string. 2. copy string1. 3. Copy string 2. this requires O(n +m) time where n and m are the lengths of string1 and string2 respectively. when you instead use a list you have O(1) appends and O(n) join making it much faster for large inputs,1
without a terminating condition,0
lol,0
@Interlink If you come from Java I would go with Python. C# will be very familiar to you already so you'll learn more by going with Python.,1
what do u mean too deep?,0
yes you always want to be cautious of functions calling themselves without any kind of condition.,0
you get stackOverflow,0
by default python only lets you go 1000 levels deep,0
oh,0
i dont need to go that far lol,0
"@! xXKiller_BOSSXx also most situations where you\'d have a function call itself can be handled another way and more efficiently. (Function calls are expensive"")",1
yes i do,0
```pydef fib(n): if n < 2: return 1 return fib(n  1) + fib(n  2)```the classic recursive example,0
oh,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx Recursive functions are often used to process treelike data structures like file trees for example.,0
in python however an iterative solution will almost always outperform a recursive solution. recursive solutions tend to be more elegant though,1
wait what does return mean?,0
Recursion can be very nice if your recursion depth is bounded.,0
still dont get what return is,0
the bad news is that Python isn't optimized for recursion so it's often better to use iteration when possible,0
like how would you use it?,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx didn't we cover this before?,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx return is used to return a value from a function back to the caller,0
sys.setrecursionlimit,0
so that mean i dont need to set as global right?,0
```pydef plus1(x): return x+1print(plus1(2))>>> 3```,0
in a function,0
ok got it,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx Yes parameters and return values are a better way of passing data between functions.,0
Rather than using globals.,0
ah,0
cuz i use alot of global,0
globals are best for things that are read but not changed.,0
^ constants,0
constants heh sorry,0
And should be used sparingly even then.,0
pycharm or vscode,0

omg,0
@Messier8 Pycharm or Visual Studio Code are the most popular choices for Python development.,0

@Messier8 Pycharm comes with more features out of the box but it requires more system resources to run smoothly. Visual Studio Code is more lightweight but you can add more features to it by installing plugins.,1
xD,0
@Messier8 Visual Studio Code is also not Pythonspecific so you can use it for other programming languages as well.,0
you may wonder well why can\'t it be done in py? <http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2009/04/tailrecursionelimination.html>,0
Hmmm,0
Hmm why is that wrong?,0
check if your try and except are lined up,0
,0
@Messier8 VS Code is yes. Pycharm has a free community edition but also paid versions. The community edition is totally good enough for serious commercial development though.,1
google is a thing,0
it's a pretty hotly debated topic,0
@Messier8 I would say so yes. You get everything you need prepackaged so you don't have to mess around with installing extensions.,1
@Messier8 You probably won't use most of the features right away but you can just ignore the parts you don't need.,1
Yes.,0
@Messier8 You're welcome,0

@NoNameJr245 Pro includes the features from Jetbrains other products webstorm and whatever the database one is called.,0
So it's suitable if you need to do full stack web development.,0
But if you don't have pro you can always write the frontend stuff in another editor.,0
Or maybe there are 3rd party extensions as well.,0
Can someone help idk what's wrong,0
it looks perfect fine to me,0
@NoNameJr245 Pro also includes stuff like run configuration templates and project types for Django and Google App Engine and stuff like that.,1
So it's extra useful if you're working with those frameworks.,0
any idea why?,0
@NoNameJr245 I wouldn't buy it privately. I've always gotten a license through work.,0
try and except in the same line,0
If I can't get a pro license for free I'd just do frontend stuff in another editor.,0
do i need except() and try()?,0
@Bast :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```False```,0
ok,0
the jetbrains products are soooo expensive if you want to pay for them yourself,0
Hmm so why it doesnt like it?,0
try and except in the same line,0
you should learn about hashing since that's what makes dicts and sets so fast @appling,0
you don't need to use functions to solve that,0
what does that mean?,0

they need to be on their own line,0
do it,0
they are on there own line,0
no,0
sets are unordered,0
ok i still dont get it it is still gaving me the same error,0

o,0
@Higgs There are already many meetups on Python like PyCon.,0
Isnt python the most popular coding language due to its accessibility?,0

What IDE'S do you guys use?,0
yeah I agree.,0
KeyboardInterrupt is the error that python throws when you cancel a running script.,0
I would recommend if you are confused by functions at this point to not try to do things with `class` and `self` in them.,1
"You need to leaarn what is called Object Oriented Programming in Python"". Its one of the most difficult things to explain in my opinion and you\'re better off with a full on guide.",1
i like to think of self as the instance that has not been declared,0
> classes are objects with attributes right ? you defines attributes to particular classes but what does instance refer to@Wylinge and instance is```pyclass A(): passb = A()```,1
@Wylinge Is your course teaching classes before functions?,0
an instace is when you say Okay make an object out of that class,0
b is the instance of A @Wylinge,0
the self it makes it so that the class knows all of its instances,0
right,0
I can't imagine trying to learn OOP from people in a chat room lol. I read. And then I read some more. And when it didnt make sense I watched other lectures and read some more.,1
but u can call an instance without self it's just that you would have to know them all,0
Its complicated.. Dont feel bad.,0
wait what was the method that gets all of the class instnace,0
You need a teacher not people in a chat room. A book. If you dont understand that book wathc a video.. If you dont understand that video read another article.,1
Its calaled Object Oriented Programming in Python,0
search thaat,0
@fix error was the one who explained it to me and he did it really well,0
I agree with that,0
@Inheritance ♦ Did you change your name and pfp a bunch of times? 🤔,0
yes,0
if u do happen to know the method that could call the class instances pls happen to ping me,0
you can't find a class's instances without fancy shit,0
just use a factory,0
and idk why you want to do that anyways,0
or a dict,0
i just want to check something,0
make a weakref dict or whatever,0
but i dict in constructor is not thread safe,0
but you don't need to,0
first actually learn oop,0
then figure out the fancy shit,0
hmm You could have an instance of the class without self rihght?,0
i tried the weakref its like a pile of unreadable stuff lol,0
@WelTrainedTango You can use a lock (or not if you're not using threading),0
do you know what self does,0
yes,0
please,0
find an oop tutorial,0
me?,0
yes,0
why?,0
but i was told to add instances into a collection before constructor completes is just bad lol,0
Since your questions make it seem like you dk oop,0
there was even a page on some site that warns you,0
well i ask stupid questions that's why,0
idek what your question is supposed to mean,0
self literally refers to the instance itself,0
Find an oop tutorial,0
he's using classes already,0
wait then why is he doing django shit then,0
or whatever that is,0
Sql alchemy?,0
the screenshot above,0
I recommend you learn the basics of python,0
before messing with sqlalchemy and shit,0
sorry PyCharm Educational Edition is ok for beginners?,0
yes,0
ok thank you,0
That's why you don't learn db shit before the basics,0
if you dk what a function is you ~~probably~~ definetly shouldn't be doing sql stuff,0
https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/RSPEC3366?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Achangehistorytabpanel,0
especially sql stuff with classes,0
also you shouldn't be starting from an orm when youre learning databases either,0
actually learn sql,0
Not sqlalchemy,0
but that doesn't matter until you learn the basics,0
if you don't know what functions and classes are,0
You should probably learn that first,0
are you following an actual tutorial,0
,0
oop has nothing to do with math,0
neither do functions,0
~~inb4 eval~~,0
what is eval?,0
the 2nd line doesn't look fully tokenized to me,0
Or is that just the top level of a recursive parser,0
Wait,0
`677` is not 42,0
sighs,0
OOP has inheritance too,0
right,0
plus composition,0
and whatever the other oop relationships are,0
please,0
Find an OOP tutorial,0
It will explain much better than us,0
since idt you have a good understanding of OOP in general,0
well,0
yes,0
But at least you can learn the concepts,0
Which idt he knows yet,0
it depends on what tutorial,0
I think their current understanding is like a struct,0
which is partially true but there's a lot more to OOP,0
classes have inheritance,0
and relationships,0

Hey @snake jazz!,0
if you're just going to apply `list` you might as well use a comprehension instead of `map`,0
`[int(value) for value in input().split()]`,0
but that's neither here nor there since that's semantically different from what OP is doing,0
(taking multiple inputs in a loop vs taking a single input and splitting it),0
honestly it just looks long because there are a lot of `prints`,0
and it's not broken up into functions,0
no you don't want `filter` because you want to work on them in order.,0
and they are similar only in that they are higherorder functions and produce iterators,0
> Ok I'll use map() and then use a function to check prime number@snake jazz no don't do it without knowing what you are doing,1
and it's not even appropriate here; it will change the meaning of your program,0
I would suggest however splitting your code up into functions,0
so like one function for factorial (assuming you want to do it yourself so don't import) one function for checking primality etc.,1

```pyfrom . import prototype```,0
> i get this error:```from . import prototype as pt> ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package```@Avangunite you can only do this if you're running it from outside,1
so you need to make it a package and do that,0
example:```| package| | __init__.py| | prototype.py| | guissignment.py| main.py```,0
if you do it from `main.py` that will work.,0
but if you run `guissignment.py` directly it will not,0
so you need to run your code from outside.,0
Without the need of creating a package:```pyimport prototype``` can work fine.,0
alternatively modify your PATH,0
> can i make it work from `guissignment.py` without any packages@Avangunite if you're running from there then yes `import prototype` will work,1
but that means if you run it from anywhere else it won't,0
@Forgotten ?,0
your where lol,0
i have no idea lol,0
> but vscode is showing unresolved import'@Avangunite yes that's because it's an absolute import,0
okay so basically there's something called `PYTHONPATH` which is a list of directories,0
when you import stuff Python looks in all of those directories.,0
when you run a script from a folder that folder is added to `PYTHONPATH`,0
which is why if you run it directly it works,0
since `prototype` exists in your working directory,0
@Forgotten `discord.py`?,0
but if you were to run it from somewhere else (and in particular assuming you were to install your package just like any other) it wouldn't,1

it would be useful also if you post the error result,0
im just trying to make the characters of the string lowercase or upercase depending on the random,0
> A) add the colon to the else > B) did you assign result to  already@NoNameJr245 yeah it still doesn\'t wpork,1
@𝔹𝕒𝕕𝕞𝕒𝕤𝕙 try it out,0
```pyimport randomorigstr = \'hello world\'result:str = for x in range(len(origstr)): case = random.randint(0 1) if case == 0: result += origstr[x].tolower() else: result += origstr[x].toupper()```,1
why do characters not have toupper and tolower functions,0
> why do characters not have toupper and tolower functions@Deleted User because its str.lower and str.upper?,0
@Deleted User they are just called upper and lower. note that python doesn't have a char type,0
```pyimport randomorigstr = \'hello world\'result:str = for x in range(len(origstr)): case = random.randint(0 1) if case == 0: result += str.lower(origstr[x]) else: result += str.upper(origstr[x])print(result)```,1
pog it works,0
Uh,0
Yeah you could do that but you could also just,0
```pyimport randomorigstr = \'hello world\'result:str = for x in range(len(origstr)): case = random.randint(0 1) if case == 0: result += origstr[x].lower() else: result += origstr[x].upper()```,1
they're both bad,0
Should use a list,0
instead of using integers to loop you should loop over the string itself,0
Guys does anybody kno what are all these other channels about? I mean I think they are trying to write the whole periodic table in channel language,1

@Deleted User see #❔｜howtogethelp,0

I mean read it,0
Ohkah,0
Im too dumb to understand,0
idk if that's better you make both chars when you don't have to,0
Oh and conrats @Aeyyy,0
congrats,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan Would you rather convert the original string to lower case and then select between the character and character.upper()?,0
no just use randint to pick whether or not to change to lower or upper,0
But random.choice is more pythonic isn't it?,0
why?,0
"@𝔹𝕒𝕕𝕞𝕒𝕤𝕙 `def myfunc(a,b,c): if sum((a,b,c)) <= 21: return sum((a,b,c)) elif sum((a,b,c)) > 21 and (a == 11 or b == 11 or c == 11): return sum((a,b,c))10 else: return BUST print(myfunc(11,10,15))`",1
Can someone explain this screenshot,0
Youre just selecting either the lowercase version of the character or the upper case version of it,0
To me random.choice seems better for that use case,0
sure,0
Instead of just saving one function call,0
> Can someone explain this screenshot@awesomelewis2007 The uptime is 49 minutes,0
Like how,0
"```py def conversion_func(text: str) > str: Randomly converts the casing of a given string."""""" return .join( char.upper() if round(random.random()) else char.lower() for char in text )```This is how the bot does it",1
is .upper and .lower expensive?,0
O(n),0
.upper is O(n)?,0
well think about what it must do,0
Its just converting to upper case,0
I'd assume there's a hash table for conversions?,0
How can I checkhow many msgs i have sent on this server?,0
a to A b to B is just an addition of a few integers to the ascii,0
Huh,0
I was talking about an already made hash table,0
Or perhaps basic addition,0
> How can I checkhow many msgs i have sent on this server?Tell mepls,0
Ill look up what the upper function does,0
!rank,0
@Deleted User you need to convert each character of the string,0
I was talking about .upper for one character,0
Is `'a'.upper()`,0
you said > is .upper and .lower expensive?@Deleted User,0
Since we're calling .upper and .lower on each individual character in the code,0
how can i check how many msgs ihave sent on this server,0
"```py def conversion_func(text: str) > str: Randomly converts the casing of a given string."""""" return .join( char.upper() if round(random.random()) else char.lower() for char in text )```",1
I see the problem,0
Wanted to know why we're saving a function call instead of using random.choice,0
Which is better?: ```True```or```1 == 1```,0
because you don't need to use random. choice,0
True,0

@ABDUL HABIBI why?,0
So does Ngnix or Apache or some other web server serve static files and for HTTP requests it forwards the request to some gateway such as WSGI (Gunicorn for python) and that interacts with the web app (django/flask) to return a response? Is my understanding correct?,1

ok thanks,0
your solution is much more wasteful @Deleted User,0
Wasteful but isn't readability the more important aspect in python? I wonder where the line is drawn,0
random.choice is for picking a random element from a sequence,0
then i guess the complexity isn't useful to mention,0
Anyone?,0
"@𝔹𝕒𝕕𝕞𝕒𝕤𝕙 `def myfunc(a,b,c): if a+b+c <= 21: return a+b+c elif a+b+c > 21 and (a == 11 or b == 11 or c == 11): if a+b+c10 > 21: return BUST"" else: return sum((a,b,c))10 else: return \'BUST\'print(myfunc(11,10,15))`",1
Where's the line drawn between readability and efficiency? Or is it just fuzzy,0
your solution will probably be about the same speed for any reasonable message but in principle you create both chars which you don't have to do and you create a list to hold them to choose from,1
Oh that's what you mean,0
hi how can I run another py file using python (i want to create another output window)?,0
my teacher uses kali linux does that mean she is a hacker,0
@Biskweet subprocess.run?,0
> subprocess.run?@Deleted User wait i'm trying,0
and random.choice is pretty much just `sequence[random.randint(0 len(sequence)` so creating a list just so you can use random.choice is unnecessary,0

Its not necessary but i recommend it,0

That was my initial approach,0
then you have two passes,0
But wouldn't it still be wasteful,0
maybe,0
So is the random.choice but it is unneccessary,0
I mean the longest discord message is 2k chars,0
Wheres the line drawn between readability and being wasteful 🙂,0
so really any solution works,0
You'll mostly always have a time difference between two approaches,0
I'm not?,0
I was the one focusing on readability,0
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯,0
All 3 approaches are O(n),0
Thats rather unnecessary?,0
A split first is the most readable?,0
Why would you want to split?,0

ok,0
Thanks @W3B we can read. Inviting people to develop a project that breaks our rules is not something we tolerate here. Stop acting like you don't understand it and let's end this discussion.,1
python lacks lots important of stuff,0
that's why,0
encapsulation,0
data hiding,0
Encapsulation is not the same as data hiding 🙂,0
Not data hiding,0
Managing access to something,0
it lacks a lot of stuff compared to C++,0

I believe python cant even have more than one constructor,0
right because it's dynamically typed and there's no overloading.,0
you mean like a class?,0
Well you can _implement_ different constructors.,0
Yeah I tried python in the past just did not fit my thing,0
Systems Programming and Software development in general,0
I needed some low level access ^,0
as well,0
yeah all these programming languages do their own thing,0
and that's what they are designed for,0
Well if you want to do lowlevel stuff a highlevel language is not the right choice 😄,0
like I\'ve seen people call python trash because they couldn\'t do kernel programming with it,0
and that really doesn't make any sense,0
because python wasn't really designed for such stuff,0
that's what I meant,0
,0
why are f strings faster than %s or + concatenation?,0
@Deleted User yes Python is different from C++ or Java. That's not surprising. It's not _lacking_ something just because it's different it just has a different philosophy.In Python there's no builtin mechanism of data hiding no. The main purpose of accessors is to describe what methods and properties are part of the interface and which are implementation details and that can be done without that (for example by enforcing a naming conventions).In C++ or Java you can still access private or protected properties by the way  but it's a bit harder than in Python,1
yep,0
how do i get the value Like? i've tired d['data'][0]['value'] it didnt work,0

You are not allowed to use that command here. Please use the #botcommands channel instead.,0
Hmm that jsonpathfinder doesnt work,0
it gave me error says Unexpected token  in json at position 1,0
wait why value':1? what does 1 mean?,0
@xtremedevx you can make a for loop to the folder path and look for the .,0
you can do that with os module i think,0
and make it loop your path and then you can format it to only look for file name with . which all file does like .png .mp4 etc...,1
Oh,0
then he need to look in html? maybe,0

Hewwo @Artemis,0

:nekogun:,0
@Flinstone! Welcome to the server,0
@Artemis It really depends. You can pretty much always redesign your system without having circular imports for example you can create a separate module for the things that the two other modules share. Can you show a bit of your code? Preferably in a help channel that may be a long one,1
This is definitely the right place to get help.,0
sorry but we can't read that screenshot at all.,0
@Flinstone! A couple of things. 1. You don't need brackets around the return value.,0
2. Since you put the print statements calling your function on the same indentation level as the body of the function Python will think they are part of the body of the function.,1
You should not be indenting the calling code.,0
I don't know what the original code looked like but the instructions are telling you to define a function so yes you should keep that.,1
importlib.reload,0
I assume?,0
@actorpus,0
@Flinstone! You might also consider putting the print inside the function so your function doesn't only generate the string to be printed but also actually prints it.,1
But that's a bit of a subjective choice.,0
Yes.,0
@Flinstone! You do have to call the function to use it which you did. The problem is that Python determines what's part of the function and what isn't by the tab/indentation level of the code. Since the lines that call the function are also indented Python thinks it's all part of the function.,1
The code that calls the function should be on the same level as the def statement.,0

I think the people who say it\'s not a great first language are 1) the type of people who want to know what\'s really going on and 2) are thinking that if you eventually will use C then you should start with C.,1
Python and C are also closely related under the hood so you can segue into C after Python,0

@Infinimata i hear that the Python 2>3 transition is going to kill Python!!1! (spoiler alert: it didn't),0
Rust for the highperformance stuff but Rust wrapped in Python makes a lot of sense,0
yeah I also find Rust's syntax very noisy and there's a lot of conceptual overhead that slows development way down,0
Clean Code uses Java for its examples so that may not be best for people weaned on Python,0
I mean one of my own favorite books is The Mythical ManMonth in big part because there isn't a line of code in it,1
@Flinstone! You did a lot of things I didn't tell you to do.,0
@Flinstone! So you introduced a bunch of new issues.,0
> I do also recommend reading the K&R C book even if you never write C. It\'s just a good fundamentals book about how things work at that lower level.@thebouv do you have examples of what K&R could teach you about how things work that a Python programmer needs to know? (Not pointers 🙂 ),1
I wish there was a better modern introduction to C than K&R or Learn C The Hard Way (which is terrible),1
@Flinstone! You should go back to what your code looked like in your first screenshot and then reread what I told you.,1
```pythonTraceback (most recent call last): File H:\\TouchPortalYTMusic\\Main.py line 129 in <module> PlayList = PlayList.index(d[\'data\'][0][\'value\'])AttributeError: \'dict\ object has no attribute \'index\'```,0

@! xXKiller_BOSSXx I would try to go for a language that is meaningfully different from Python in order to expand your horizons. A statically typed language for example or a language that gives you direct memory control or a functional language for example.,1
yeah picking a project is Really Hard... Harder then coding lol,0

Oh,0
It's difficult to accidentally break your PC.,0
your os is very smart so unless you're trying to mess with it you'll probably be fine,0

C allows you to do verSegmentation fault (core dumped),0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx There are different benefits to learning either one.,0
ah,0
i think this is a little off topic?,0
You can do most anything in C just not as easily as in many other languages,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx C will teach you how things work under the hood in a lot of other languages.,0

"!e ```pyprint(""hey there you sep=""#"")```",0

Hi I am a new person to programing and I want learn how to do programing and I am interested in build websites machine learning and many more what should I start with?,1
!resources @Deleted User,0
,0
@Urkchar you're probably going to need Decimal for that,0
you should not start with assembly. imo it is way too low level to be of any use to a python programmer,1
if it's late you should go to sleep. it's not very beneficial to learn when you're tired,0
😃,0
MIPS?,0
MIPS isnt a language?,0
didn't you say you learned C/Cpp before that,0
python has its place but it's not superior to every other language,0
,0
Hilarious,0
yeah don't do that,0
it's not relevant to anything you'll do in python if anything it would deter someone from wanting to program,0
hey guys what does TypeError: \'NoneType\ object is not iterable,0

do i like copy and paste the whole thing,0
you should convert it to a decimal as soon as possible so you are more precise,0

,0
ok,0
@Urkchar use decimal.Decimal.log10,0
so like decimal.Decimal(2).ln(),0
wait why does numpy.log do natural log,0
dm me if you can help me with making py to exe,0
!docs decimal.Decimal.ln,0
,0
shouldnt that be `ln`,0
numpy.log is natural log,0
no idea,0
!d numpy.log10,0
,0
`decimal.Decimal(2).ln()` is the solution for pure decimal anyways,0
yeah that's better i forgot about that one,0
@Urkchar,0
(You should almost always be using natural log probably),0
you dont need to use numpy for stuff that python can do on scalars,0
https://paste.pythondiscord.com/cahotoqulu.sql HELLLPPP,0
@Deleted User instead of saying HELLLPPP please ask a question,0
oh,0
what package are you trying to install?,0
ok,0
which package,0
it most likely doesn't have support for 3.9 yet,0
a thing to make py to exe,0
Cython?,0
whats that,0
look up the latest supported version for it and use that,0
no,0
whats the package name,0
dont give me a description give me the actual name,0
pyinstaller or pytoexe?,0
wdym,0
why i keep getting NameError: name Tracktitle is not defined Even tho i made it global in the define,0
its a video,0
@Deleted User what command did you run,0
dont install random shit unless you know what it doeos and at least what its fucking called,0
pip install r requirements.txt,0
i know what it does 😭,0
where did you get this reqs.txt from,0
if you dont know what the package is called,0
that sounds kinda sketchy,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx it's possible the line that defines `Tracktitle` doesn't run make sure the definition is running,0
ok,0
im very confused,0
@Urkchar visual studio?,0
because i already have it,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan its autopytoexe he DM'd me the video link,0
it probably doesn't have support for 3.9,0
so what do i do,0
don't use 3.9,0
get the version in the video?,0
but in the updatestatus() i made it call Main(),0
greenlet only has 3.9 support on linux,0
so shouldnt it mean the Main() is ran,0
so use python3.8,0
oh i dont need to do that?,0
unless you want to install whls manually,0
ok i removed,0
@Deleted User tldr: use python3.8,0

does anyone know whats wrong with this? it has me put an input but never prints anything,0
it just doe sthis,0
im in help argon,0
@Deleted User you have to call the function and pass in the input:```pythonsum_integers(end_numbers)```,0
> @Deleted User you have to call the function and pass in the input:> ```python> sum_integers(end_numbers)> ```@Befell okay wait so i kindof understand but what,1
@S.pamatz When you `import math` does `math` require your program or does your program require `math`?,0
@Deleted User so in your code you defined sum_integers but you never called it and passed in the input,0
oh,0
wait so i need to change the end_number in the input to sum_integers?,0
okay that didnt work im guessing not that,0
@S.pamatz If `A` needs something from `B` you import `B` in `A`. For example when you import the `math` module you do that because you need to access something in `math` not because your program is needed for `math` to work.,1

NP. To explain a bit more why I won't use bools... The more you need to keep track of the more dangerous things get. Say I add two new difficulties Super Easy and Impossible. Now I need to make sure that any place in code that updates the difficulty takes these two new difficulties into account(Keep in mind it's probably a bad sign if you're updating values like that in many places),1
.,0
hmmmm,0
So rather than keep track of maybe 3 variables (which may change to 5 6 or 9999 later on) I can just have one variable and mutually exclusive values,1
The memory difference is pretty tiny as well but yeah... it's still gonna be extra memory used up 😛,0

for discord,0
"Red Hex/RGB color code = #FF0000 = 25565536+0256+0 = (255,0,0) `RED=255 GREEN=0 BLUE=0.`",0

Variables store things. They're useful for keeping track of valuesFunctions do things. They're useful for when you need to do the same set of actions more than onceFor loops loop through things. While loops loop while something is true,1
Yeah. Just make sure to only update what you want to update. Look up single responsibility and invariant,0

10 mb would be great for something like a modern game but terrible for something that just prints out `Hello World`,1

No. You don't even need to look at the variables to see that they're different,0
The first one returns something the second does... who knows what,0
could u explain what the first one is doing,0
and as well as what the second one is doing,0

Hello is PIL library supports different languages? I drawed text in korean it gived empty box,0
TBH I'm not 100% sure `return any(...) and ctx.channel != bot_channel` works. I think you want `return any(...) and (ctx.channel != bot_channel)`,1
It makes a pretty big difference in terms of the result,0
`return value`,0
hmm I want to reutrn if the member does not ahve any of the role and the channnel is bot channel.,1
so is that what that return is doing?,0
> Hello is PIL library supports different languages? I drawed text in korean it gived empty boxAnyone know this?,0
`return` is returning the value that you get from the comparisons. Assuming it all works,0
@TheKing could u explain the comparisn then?,0
Try expanding things out a bit. Think about it in English (or whatever language),0
No. Some functions may just do work ('sideeffects') and don't return anything,0
At this point though it's probably better to listen to Darr and not worry about what I said,0
@Darr :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```001 | look. I don't return anything explicitly002 | output is: None```,1

I don't understand what this means `>` like i just don't get it,0
> can we see some code and output then@Flash. Okay sending in minutes,0
ohhh ```pydef soemthing(): return 1```in this case `>` this will mean what the function will return and it will be int so the function is going to be ```pydef something() > int: return 1```,1
right???,0
ohh i see,0
how would I make this into a return statement```pyif any(student_role not in member.roles for student_role in staff_roles): if ctx.channel != bot_channel```,1
well it should return true or false according to the members role and the chanel,0
but I just can't make it into a return statement,0

@cyberjj999 That's the normal approach with exceptions.,0
You raise them where the error occurs and you catch them where you can meaningfully handle them.,0
Handling them can mean different things depending on the context. It can be recovering from the error by retrying the operation or printing an error message or whatever.,1
@cyberjj999 You normally want to raise exceptions from multiple places and only handle them in a few centralized places.,0
"> how do you print a string and int together?@Zaki use `,` like `print(""wa dwa  23)`",0
"```pydef foo(): # stuff if some_error_condition: raise SomeException(""foo failed"")def bar(): # other stuff if some_other_error_condition: raise SomeOtherException(""bar failed"")try: foo() bar()except Exception as e: logging.error(e)```",1
^ You could do this for example,0
"> @Zaki use `,` like `print(""wa dwa  23)`like that",0
Raise from multiple places catch and log the error in one place,0
What do you mean?,0
works in mine,0
You generally want to catch specific exceptions because you usually want to handle different exceptions in different ways.,0
Some exceptions may not allow your program to go on running so you just want to document the cause and then exit.,1
Other exceptions may need to be logged but don't require the program to exit.,0
Yet others can be recovered from by retrying.,0
etc.,0
The exception contains a stack trace which shows you both which function caused the error and which functions were called to reach that point,1
@cyberjj999 Exceptions allow you to specify a custom message describing the issue.,0
@cyberjj999 If you want to provide more specialized error information for a given exception you can catch that exception and then reraise your own custom exception.,1
"@cyberjj999 You can do this for example: ```pytry: raise MyExceptionToBeWrapped(""I have twisted my ankle"")except MyExceptionToBeWrapped as e: raise MyWrapperException(""I\'m not in a good shape"") from e```",1

@cyberjj999 You do need a different try catch for each different type of error that you want to describe.,0

because of the scope,0
the function is using a local scope,0
im pretty sure u cant use x = 1 in python,0
yes you can,0
pass X into the function,0
```pyglobal x``` instead of passing an argument in to a function.,0
```X = 10def X_exponential(X): X = 1 return XX_exponential(X)```,0
the code i sent worked for me,0
Yes place `global x` inside your function and you will be able to reference `x` from there.,0
Note that this will allow referencing `x` only in that function so if you want to reference `x` again in another function you'll have to make `x` a global name again.,1
Heads up though you likely don't want to use a global. They're typically unecessary and dangerous,0
how are they dangerous?,0
Very,0
huh?,0
They're easy to mutate by accident,0
if someone can plz help with this,0
`X = 10def X_exponential(): global X X = 1 return X`,0

correct ans= 2200 python gives 2600,0
Inheritance: As your programs get bigger and more complex you end mutating data in dozens hundreds thousands or even millions of times,1
hmm,0
:thinkmon:,0
If you make a mistake somewhere with a global variable that will likely have far reaching consequences. You go from debugging one or two functions to potentially your entire program,1
@BakkarBakkar but 4k0.15=600,0
Yes but it looks like they just want to decrement the variable `x` by 1 so in this case it should work just fine.,1
600+1600=2200 not 2600,0
Nothing else just that one `x` variable...,0
Yeah it's NBD here. It's just a word of warning,0
It's best not to develop bad habits,0
I personally have never had a need for the `global` keyword.,0
~~I custom compile my own Python and remove `global` from the language~~,0
Lol,0
No :|That sounds so bad,0
Works fine for me,0
what happens when you change the income variable to 20000 @Zenorph,0
just to test it out,0
You are not allowed to use that command here. Please use the #botcommands channel instead.,0

`print(f'The taxes are {(2000016000)0.15+1600}') `,0
just as a test,0
huh,0
something else is changing your income variable,0
If you're happy with globals then keep using them. I don't think you'll find many (any?) experienced developers who use them outside of very specific and niche scenarios though,1
probably some hidden tax from the feds,0
haha,0
The only time I've ever used them was for embedded systems stuff... can't remember why though. `extern` or something?,0

I dont believe so but not sure,0
I dont think so @TheKing,0
Hello,0
Everyone,0
I use ``import osclear = lambda: os.system('cls')clear()``,0
does that not achive the same thing?,0
always worked for me,0
but yah its a lot more variable than my method,0
perhaps,0
sublime has nothing to do with it,0
I'm sure repl.it runs on a Linux machine so it would be `clear` instead of `cls`.,0

How or why would you use multiple objects for the following then? Settings and configuration data a renderer (simple 2D game) IO handler thing a stream consumer and an input handler,1
Having classes to carry around data is nice (since namedtuples are immutable?) but... having a ton of instances seems kind of pointless,1

```pyangels = [100 200 300 400]demons = [1 3 1000000 100]```how would I check if any of the elements in demons are not in angels using the any() function?,1
How do you guys manage your SQLite statements,0
no I want to check if demons does not have any of the elements in angles,0
Yeah... actually that's something that's kind of confusing,0
How much state do you keep track of?,0
For example ```py@uniqueclass GamemModes(Flag): GAME_INIT = auto() GAME_PROC = auto() GAME_END = auto()@uniqueclass ST_UI(Flag): # Menus ST_MAIN_MENU = auto() ST_SETUP_TURN = auto() ST_SETTINGS = auto() ST_PLAY_AGAIN = auto()```,1
so it should return false because demons has one of the elements that is in angels,0
@Inheritance ♦ ```pyangels = [100 200 300 400]demons = [1 3 1000000 100]angels_set = set(angels)print(all(i not in angels_set for i in demons)) # true if demons doesn't contain any angels values```,1
@Doctor i don't understand what that is doing could u explain,0
It seems like you have to deal with a ton of tiny state machines. It's really interesting trying to make sure you're always in a valid state,1
It's checking if all demon values aren't in angels,0
i meant step by step,0
why are using a set first of all?,0
@Jac_k ```pyprint(all([1 2 3 0]))> False```,0
fast membership tests,0
I don't get it,0
Ehm that's not the solution i think @Jac_k,0
nvm tho,0
I can't read 🙂,0
why use a ternary when you can just use bool,0
Hmmm,0
`print(not bool(set(angels) & set(demons)))` ?,0
In what language Python?,0
I want to understand what's happening and what I am doing wrong so this is whatI currently have```pyif any(x not in demons for x in angels): #do stuff```and this don't work.I don't get it,1
no cause I want to check if it not in angels,0
move the not outside,0
hmm k,0
Definitely send it via PM or something if you don't mind would love to take a look,0
```pyif not any(x in demons for x in angels):```like this?,0
try it,0

hmm let me think for a sec,0
@NoMrcy Hello,0
@Jac_k actually set intersection is slower,0
yep,0
Wait how did you test it?,0
sec,0

I think you're building the set too aren't you?,0
nah,0
So you're including the build time for the set but not the list,0
oh yeah,0
you're right,0
i copypasted code without thinking,0
```pyangels = {i for i in range(100_000)}angels.add('2_222_222')demons = {i for i in range(100_000 200_000)}demons.add('2_222_222')%timeit n 1000 all(i not in angels for i in demons)%timeit n 1000 not bool(angels & demons)57.1 µs ± 214 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs 1000 loops each)614 µs ± 6.66 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs 1000 loops each)```,1

I didn't write it for performance so I don't have any timing,0
```pyangels = {100 200 300 400}demons = {1 3 1000000 100}print(demons & angels)```,0
Also not sure what you guys were doing so I just wrote that,0
your solution is slower for some reason and i don't really know why,0
Problem was to check if angels and demons have unique values,0
why did u guys use sets?,0
They're faster,0
how faster 1 second?,0
times faster,0
"Hmm... I can\'t run your code. I\'m getting `Argument 1 to add of set has incompatible type str""; expected int""` and don\'t know how to use the timeit functions 😦",1

"@bigbotpein What do you mean by clean up""?",0
Hey Could sone help me understand something in #helpgrapes,0
@bigbotpein Python has a garbage collector which automatically cleans up memory when it is no longer referenced.,0
So you don't need to manually delete objects.,0
Just make sure to not store references to memory you don't want to keep around.,0
It's not necessarily instantly deleted and it is possible to manually instruct the GC to run but that's almost never necessary.,1
So I wouldn't worry about it unless you actually experience problems with memory usage.,0
@PureFunctor it's actually only faster if they intersect,0
```pyfrom timeit import angels = {i for i in range(100_000)}demons = {i for i in range(100_000 200_000)}print(timeit('all(i not in angels for i in demons) globals=globals() number=1000))print(timeit('all(angels & demons) globals=globals() number=1000))python3.8 stuff.py 3.46082435200150940.43437747999996645```,1
That's what I got,0
@TheKing > @PureFunctor it's actually only faster if they intersect@Doctor,0
@bigbotpein Well you can still do memory profiling on your application before you distribute it if you suspect this might become an issue.,1
Hmm... but these don't look like they intersect?,0
@TheKing `'all(i not in angels for i in demons)'` is faster only if sets intersect,0
"Isn't angels from 0  99,999 and demons from 100,000  199,999?",0
If they don't it's slower,0
Ah okay,0
@TheKing ```pyangels = {i for i in range(100_000)}demons = {i for i in range(100_000 200_000)}%timeit n 100 all(i not in angels for i in demons)%timeit n 100 angels & demonsdemons.add(55_555)%timeit n 100 all(i not in angels for i in demons)%timeit n 100 angels & demons7.98 ms ± 79.9 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs 100 loops each)616 µs ± 3.79 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs 100 loops each)34 µs ± 826 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs 100 loops each)612 µs ± 3.52 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs 100 loops each)```,1
@bigbotpein You could use the mock library and write something on top of that to record and replay data maybe.,0
I'm not familiar with any library or tool that does exactly that.,0
you're forgetting that he has his data in lists so converting to a set adds more time,0
Hey what is `rediscache`,0
@TheKing https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset.isdisjoint,0
> i love python@NoMrcy I do too,0
Could you give us full stacktrace? @Dalvinchi,0
@pratt It apparently blocks the thread until the condition is notified by another thread.,0
the error isn't in that block of code i think,0
@pratt threading doesn't have a condition() function I'm assuming you're referring to the class threading.Condition which has a wait() method.,0
"For each in people_here: print (""Hello people"")",0
do you need conda packages?,0
yeah but what packages,0
@pratt The publisher and subscriber threads presumably both reference the same condition. The condition is used to synchronize the threads. When one thread acquires the condition and calls wait it releases the condition and blocks. When the other thread acquires the condition and calls notify the wait call returns and the first thread continues executing.,1
conda sounds good then,0
@pratt Or well technically the waiting thread must first reacquire the lock before it returns from wait() so the first thread won't continue until the second thread releases the condition after having called notify().,1
@pratt blocks the thread. It stops and does nothing.,0
calling wait() releases the lock then when the other thread notifies the condition the first thread will reacquire the lock before returning from wait(),1
So like:,0
@alan less memory consumption at least,0
one gives you a generator,0
^,0
1. Thread 1 calls acquire() and acquires the lock2. Thread 1 calls wait()3. Thread 1 releases the lock (automatically)4. Thread 1 blocks5. Thread 2 calls acquire() and acquires the lock6. Thread 2 calls notify()7. Thread 1 continues but must reacquire the lock before returning from wait() and thread 2 still has it7. Thread 2 calls release() and releases the lock8. Thread 1 reacquires the lock automatically9. Thread 1 returns from wait()10. Thread 1 calls release() and releases the lock,1
@pratt ^,0
is it possible to have a try & except block inside another try & except block?,0
No problem,0
oh,0
yo whoever told me to not use writeable globals (im talking about c# rn it could apply to python too ig idk) my code became so much fucking messier if i need to add one more variable to a function (which needs to be passed to my last function in the chain) i need to pass that new parameter of the first function TO EVERY SINGLE FUNCTIOn until i get to the last one,1
holy shit not using globals is cumbersome,0

@JagTheFriend It doesn't,0
range does,0
anybody got an idea as to why it isnt opening in my shell?,0
It doesn't...,0
@Hollando put wrong file name?,0
Range does,0
@pratt the file name is spil,0
huh,0
me to,0
sorry had 2 files with same things in them file spil is here,0
```pyimport itertoolsfor i in itertools.count(0 1): print(i)```@JagTheFriend,0
@vinam yes,0
@JagTheFriend Just agree that `for` doesn\'t have any limit,0
@Hollando myb put like python2 spil.py,0
It just iterates over some iterable like range,0
But range isn't infinite,0
@Aboo Minister my eyes are bliding xd,0
@pratt called my main function,0
hi,0
"@JagTheFriend if u want to go infit loop u can do like while true: print(""text"")",0
try it out,0
kinda weird because i got 1 file which is using same commands and no problem running that,0
nice,0
like u can go for loop but i dont like it,0
hmm,0
Don't do that,0
ikr,0
nah its just,0
put break ;D,0
@pratt debugger didnt show any erorrs,0
agree,0
imagine using for loop xd,0
@pratt ohh okay will try that thx,0
jk btw,0
@JagTheFriend What's the point if it's easier to do with loops?,0
Plus `math.factorial` is a thing,0
thats brain des@JagTheFriend for me,0
use frikin while,0
You can use for loops anyway,0
so hard ???,0
```pydef factorial(n: int): fac = 1 for i in range(1 n+1): fac = i return facprint(factorial(3))```,0
U can use for loop but in that case u can use while loop bcs ur doing infint loop,0
I doesn't 🙂,0
Loops are better than recursion in most cases,0
> i prefer recursive function makes me look cooler@JagTheFriend nah man,0
agree,0
i go bois,0
bye ;D,0
yea,0
@JagTheFriend for example?,0
adios amigos,0
Depends on the language too. Recursion is kind of shit in Python :/,0
no in python an iterative solution will pretty much always perform better,0
@pratt think its a problem with def because none of the line works but tried just printing something and that gave no issues,1
@JagTheFriend It isn't that readable as iterative solution 🙂,0
most of the time a recursive solution will be more elegant,0
How do I get an `Invite` object in discord.py from a invite URL?,0
got it,0
!d discord.utils.resolve_invite,0
,0
@JagTheFriend Solution that uses iteration,0
ehm,0
Can you post line 79?,0
@JagTheFriend That's not what i'm talking about,0
Yeah,0
you won't really notice the difference in solutions between iteration and recursion until you get to bigger examples,0
for something small like fibonnaci the differences are miniscule,0
1001 = recursion depth limit tho,0
And make sure to use a language with good recursion support. Tail end optimization for example,0

@mks We don't allow recruitment on the server no. Sorry.,0
@Deleted User Sorry I replied to the wrong person.,0

@Parkwad My personal suggestion is Pycharm Community Edition. It's a fully featured development environment out of the box and you don't have to worry about configuring it or installing plugins to make it work well with Python.,1
yeah pycharm is super good,0
I am downloading PyCharm should I create associations with a checkbox that says [].py,0
@Parkwad It just makes Windows open py files with Pycharm. You can do it if you want to but I don't find it super useful myself.,1

@LostHawk You don't generally need to add Pycharm to the path,0
It's unusual to trigger it from the command line.,0
Even on Linux I use Jetbrains Toolbox to start Pycharm.,0
I do have toolbox on the path though,0
I prefer toolbox since it handles updates automatically.,0
And I use multiple Jetbrains products as well.,0
No,0
Toolbox is just a launching utility,0
@LostHawk You have to configure an interpreter for the project. I suggest you create a virtual environment for each project.,0
And then install the modules you need only for that project in the venv.,0
@LostHawk,0
@LostHawk It will list the modules currently installed to that environment below the dropdown.,0
So if you can't use modules you previously installed with pip the configured environment is probably different from the one you installed the modules to.,1
"@SharkBaitBilly ```pyimport jsonobj = json.loads(your_string)the_code = obj[""code""]```",0

@Higgs Probably because it came over a network.,0
@LostHawk You can install modules directly in that view.,0
,0
@Gabi0312 ask in #gamedevelopment,0
no @Offxdreams,0
@xantorn Probably because you haven't indented your code properly.,0
Python is sensitive to indentation since it's how it delineates code blocks.,0
@xantorn In C whitespace doesn't matter. Anything between a pair of curly brackets is part of a code block and it can look however you want. In Python everything after a statement that ends in a colon that is indented one additional level is part of that code block.In C: ```cint foo() {return 1; // This is fine}```But in Python```pydef foo():return 1 # This is not finedef foo(): return 1 # But this is ```,1

Oh yeah,0

You might want to install Python 3.8 instead because since 3.9 is so new that the library doesn't have precompiled dependencies go to https://python.org/downloads/ and find the Python version 3.8.6 and install it (you can uninstall the 3.9 if you don't feel like you'll need it.) then try installing the `discord.py` library again with `pip install discord.py`.,1
Also to check for installed Python versions you can do `py 0`.,0

Trying to print the current time and date into a widget window by using Tkinter but I'm obviously missing something,0

`print` always returns `None`,0
@Aeden well the C in CSV means comma so....,0
@LSD is it graded?,0
@LSD that sounds an awful lot like a homework question which we're not going to help you with unless you ask a far more specific question,1

@Aeden ok I'm confused what does that have to do with using `:` as a delineator for a data file?,0
@Infinimata Appreciate it,0
I think I put this the wrong way,0
@Deleted User `datetime.now` is just the function object. `datetime.now()` calls that function and returns the current time.,0

Python is flexible but not Silly Putty,0
Yeah. It would be cool if we could do something like in my example above (without things like ForbiddenFruit),0
I think the problem is once you give people the ability to overload builtin operators you wind up making it too easy to turn every program in the language into its own dialect,1
Yeah. A lot of people (hobbyists and beginners) would probably start overwriting builtins instead of learning to do it properly as well. And like you said we do expect the language to behave in the same way in all files,1
If we do `3/2` and change it to return the remainder of the operation instead of the float we suddenly made the code really odd. There are also other simple things to use that would make a lot more sense. If we allowed changing the builtins that easily some people may turn that into other things,1
Not quite. Check out my code above @kendalk08https://discord.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/769685928129724437,0

anyone know about threading? i am bit confued i need somehow to run my Main() function then run updatestatus() function as fast as possible but i am not sure how,1
i tired using Threads but it says Threads can only be started once,0
Yes,0
i've been trying for like 2hrs now and i still got nothing done,0
Hmm then what do i need to do?,0
@RightNxw have you installed requests?,0
``pip install requests``,0
^,0
Oh,0
heyyyy I have a question,0
but the main() is the one setting up all the vars and the the updatestatus() use all the vars,0
aka sending the vars,0
i have a hashed string I have the hash but I don't know the hashing function used how can I know ?,1
nvm i can just switch,0
but then i need somehow run updatestatus() function,0
the hash is 32 characters long @dewi,0
because i already have while loops for recving data so it wouldnt work,0
because it has to recv something in order to run the while loops,0
@RightNxw if you have python from the official website you already have pip,0
> that's probably MD5@dewi nope I checked :/,0
so i can't run the updatestaus() in the while loop,0
so any idea what could i do?,0
> @Biskweet what are you trying to do@dewi being able to decrypt other hashed msgs,0
@dewi,0
but for that I first need to find what function is used,0
@ak._. `return` ends a function so it never gets to run the `return False`,0
well you can't learn things quickly it will take some time,0
@ak._. You can return multiple things but it needs to be with the same `return` statement`return thing1 thing2` is valid,0
so is there anything i could do? to fix my issue?,0
yes,0
you have windows ?,0
launch the terminal,0
cmd,0
maybe you forgot to add to path,0
> maybe you forgot to add to path@! xXKiller_BOSSXx no,0
you have this?,0
No @dewi it sends the data to a server,0
Hi,0
@AydenGamin I don\'t want to be rude but I literally typed learn python on google and found 357 million results,0
??,0
@RightNxw type: pip install requests,0
i need the Main() and UpdateStatus() keep running like forever,0
until the server sends me a message that i need to close it,0
@AydenGamin don't look for videos,0
👍,0
@AydenGamin look on udemy or things like that,0
Hmm i dont get it,0
Yes,0
,0
!paste,0
@RightNxw that command I told you to enter was not meant to install pip but to check it was installed (I made you download a very useful python module to test),1
https://paste.pythondiscord.com/uxibidavem.py,0
that's my code,0
> Hello everyone can you guys help me with List comprehension ?yup,0
So that way when the updatestatus() runs it will also run mainthread but that was just a test,0
Umm where do i put it?,0
so the last line?,0
@anurag a list comprehension is an instruction that adds a value if a condition is true like that : [action is condition for value in variable],1
k,0
k removed,0
> C++ @Максим_lllll@dewi actually it depends,0
so what do i put inside if __name__ == __main__'?,0
but it's really equivalent,0
```pythonif __name__ == __main__'```,0
> Yes @Biskweet I know what it is and even tried solving.. but getting wrong at some point@anurag ok let's do it step by step what is the action you want to do ?,1
k,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx don\'t forget :,0
xD okie,0
wait but that just runs the updatestatus i also need the Main() to be running as well,0
> @Biskweet C++ is faster than C# and C in almost everything@dewi 🤔 i agree for C# but not for C,1
And C?,0
> C++ is old and outdated C# is better@valleau for your own security do no say that to a developer,0
C++ C# and C have something in common each other?,0
@dewi do i also put Main() in the if __name__ == main thing?,0
@Максим_lllll C++ is basically C language but with orientedobject features C# is a totally different language,0
Dang it my code didn't save even though it said successfully saved.,0
> @Biskweet I want to print the list as it is but after every single string in the list 1. want to append    2. doesn't include numbers@anurag ok so you already know you will have to list all the values in your list like this : [value for value in list_name],1
Its worth to learn C?,0
> @Biskweet It is not totally different to be honest@dewi oh ok,0
@dewi,0
Hi!,0
🤔,0
Hmm then where do i put it?,0
> Even used type cmd to exclude the number@anurag cool you see where we're going,0
next step is adding an action,0
but what is its condition?,0
so before the thread runs?,0
@anurag in other words you want to do something to your selected value if a condition is true,0
,0
@Максим_lllll Assembly level language is extremely fast but you seriously do not want to learn that at your level go for C++,1
any idea why that happends?,0
maybe you used tabs instead of spaces or the opposite,0
wdym,0
python does not like mixing tabs indentation with spaces indentation,0
so then what should i do?,0
well check what's indenting your line and compare it to a normal line,0
Pycharms does that already I believe,0
Sublime Text too,0
idk never used atom,0
I'm convinced Barry is a python wizard,0
Hmm it didnt work @dewi,0
i tired add print() in update thing and it never printed anything,0

have u found anything wrong with it? @dewi,0
should i remove it?,0
let\'s say your first list is stored in the variable first_list ok ?,0
well because if i use threading.timer it will always loop the update,0
wdym,0
"```second_list = [(value + "") for value in first_list if type(value)==str else value]```",0
should work not sure tho,0
Hmm,0
oh so ill have to make it global,0
wait no,0
it does not,0
ok now maybe,0
xD,0
wait so i need put timer = threading.Thread(3 updatestatus) after the updatestatus() function?,0

welp what should i do?,0
Umm,0
well i need the updatestatus to be running all the time,0
k,0
so what should i do?,0
because the loop is blocking the if name == main thing],0

should i put the if name == main before the loop?,0

is possble to make it so because socket recv thing in the while loops is possble to make it so if it has nothing or recv nothing it will just pass,1
is that a thing?,0
i would just use point_of_rotation,0
it's ez to read also you can just copy and paste,0

yes,0
@kutiekatj9,0
I did this for work a couple of months ago let me grab the code/SO I referenced,0

@! xXKiller_BOSSXx This is generally the method I implemented at work for listening to data but also doing other stuff while there wasn't data <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2719017/howtosettimeoutonpythonssocketrecvmethod>,1
oh,0
I'm fond of it because it works with Python and tons of other workloads that I have that are parallel to it so I can always turn things off if I don't need them for a particular project,1
"```pyage = 12if age < 4: price = 0 print(""Your admission cost is $0."")elif age < 18: price = 25 print(""Your admission cost is $25."")else: price = 40 print(""Your admission cost is $40."")print(f""Your admission cost is $[price}."")```",1

@kutiekatj9 Hmm mysocket.setblocking(0) in the while loop or no?,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx It's something you only need to set once so outside,0
ok making sure,0
then ```pythonready = select.select([mysocket] [] [] timeout_in_seconds)if ready[0]: data = mysocket.recv(4096)``` in the while loop right?,0
yes I believe so,0
We don't do oneonone tutoring here but we will help with individual questions,0
BlockingIOError: [WinError 10035] A nonblocking socket operation could not be completed immediately,0
Hmm,0
@NBA Oldboy for that you'd want to use something like the Pillow image library,0
@NBA Oldboy Pillow is written partly in C so it should work pretty snappily,0
"```pythons = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET socket.SOCK_STREAM)s.connect((HOST,PORT))s.sendall(b\'{""type"":""pair"",""id"":""YoutubeMusic""}\\')s.setblocking(0)data = s.recv(1024)print(repr(data))``` @kutiekatj9 is this not allowed?",0
The `any` and `all` builtins can be useful for such things @D. 🔮,0
"@lord ```pythonfor thing in things: if condition(thing): print(""YAY"") breakelse: print(""BOO"")```",0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx That looks correct at first glance are you getting an error?,0
Yes,0
@D. 🔮 instead of `break` just set a sentinel condition and then check it after the loop,0
Traceback (most recent call last): File H:\\TouchPortalYTMusic\\Main.py line 14 in <module> data = s.recv(1024)BlockingIOError: [WinError 10035] A nonblocking socket operation could not be completed immediately[Finished in 1.1s],1
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx So it's probably because you're trying to recv data before there is any. I'd use select to wait until data is ready and then do s.recv(1024),1
and this is the loop```python try: ready = select.select(data [] [] timeout_in_seconds) if ready[0]: data = s.recv(4096) sdata = data.decode() d = json.loads(sdata) except(json.decoder.JSONDecodeError): pass```,1
so how do i do that? @kutiekatj9,0
that is a list,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx I'm a bit confused about your code there. You're passing in data where the socket should go there. Also you are using select there but you're not using it earlier where the error is occurring. One thing you could potentially do is moving the `s.setblocking(0)` below the first `data = s.recv(1024)`,1
@FalloutSeeker docstrings and comments describing why I've done something have helped me a lot,0
```pythonready = select.select(data [] [] 1)```,0
is that right?,0
because i am getting error about it,0
OSError: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket,0
why are you passing in something that isn't a socket there?,0
wdym unless it's data.select(),0
select.select() takes a socket as its first argument since it's going to be checking the socket until it's ready,0
oh,0
TypeError: arguments 13 must be sequences,0
what does that mean?,0
I'm not sure what's the line that's associated with that error?,0
ready = select.select(s [] [] 1),0
@Dolphin that will just create an alias for the first object. You need to create a second instance```pyball1 = Ball()ball2 = Ball()```,1
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx s needs to be in a `[]`,0
🤬,0
Okie,0
there's also `copy.copy()`,0
```pyimport copyball1 = Ball()ball2 = copy.copy(ball1)```,0
@kutiekatj9,0
I dont get it why it does that?,0
So it looks like d is a list and not a dict can you add a `print(d)` in there to see what it looks like? It might be the case that you need to do `d[0]['type']`,1
i am not sure how to print because it's in that ifs so that means the d will only defined when the if is raned,1
@Максим_lllll your list comp is building a string you can't call a string like a function,0
ye i got error of d is not defined,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx so you probably only way to run the other code when you have data no? So you either want to build a function and call it within that if or move the code underneath that if.,1
Oh yeah i am dumb...,0
i cant sleeo,0
its 3:45am,0
@Максим_lllll you're trying to call functions programmatically from a list?,0
```pyfunclist = [func1 func2 func3]# run func1funclist[0]()```,0
someone tell how to get sleeo fast,0
Hmm why i keep getting this error? it looks right to me,0
@Dolphin try `copy.deepcopy`,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx somewhere in there there's a tab or a space that doesn't belong. Even if it lines up it has to either all be tabs or all be spaces,1
@Krabyshek I only see warnings there not any errors. Are you hitting a problem?,0
What's the problem/error you're getting?,0
Oof,0
i have 4hours to sleep and im not tired,0
@Максим_lllll You have to put _functions_ in the list not _function names_,0
@Krabyshek how are you starting the bot?,0
"```pydef f(): print(""hello"")def g(): print(""world"")functions = [f g] # list of _functions_functions = [""f g""] # list of _strings_ no relation to the `f` or `g` functions```",1
What's in that server.bat file? Also what's in your bot.py file?,0
@Максим_lllll There isn't an easy way to do it. Putting functions in a list is not that bad. You can remove the repetition completely by using decorators but that's a pretty advanced topic and I would say it's overengineering for this simple case. I see that you don't like duplication of the order: you specify the execution order both in the function name and in the list.Instead don't name the functions `task1` `task2` etc. give your functions descriptive names: `calculate_resistance` `calculate_number_of_buses` and so on. Then the only place you specify the order will be the list.,1
@CaptainBanter we might have an answer!,0
@𝙉𝙖𝙣𝙞 that sounds like a question for #discordbots,0
@Krabyshek hmmm... I'm not sure. If it's a discord bot #discordbots might be able to help,0
@Максим_lllll what is this list of functions? Why do you need to call them all in order?,0
i have the same question 🙂,0
decorators are a good way to register functions for later access,0
the tasks seem completely unrelated not sure why you'd put them in the same program,0
Anyone recommend a good library to use if I'm looking to make a script that creates a shipping label (address barcode name logo etc) from data in a database?,1

> so i have a function which im supposed to run 100 times and get the average and the output of each of those 100 times depends on a random.Random(). My issue is that the program is using the same random number in every one of those 100 iterations@CaptainBanter Can you show us the code? Are you using `seed`?,1
@CaptainBanter it sounds like you're not reinvoking `random.random()` on each iteration of the loop that you're just invoking it once outside the loop,1
"```pybot = Bot(command_prefix=\'?\')@bot.eventasync def on_ready(): print(""We\'re on."")@bot.eventasync def on_member_join(member): print(""Should print if someone just joined."")bot.run(TOKEN)```This is a small snippet from my code `on_member_join` doesn\'t seem to do anything. No errors it just doesn\'t execute.",1
`on_ready` does however,0
@CaptainBanter show us your code?,0
no,0
@Krabyshek not quite. `bor.run( TOKEN )` should be `bot.run(TOKEN)` and it should be unindented so all the way to the left,1
does anyone know the problem where u try opening ur script on the python and u press open with python it opens but closes very quickly.,1
I don't think you've actually changed anything,0
bor != bot. It needs to be `bot` and it also needs to be all the way to the left not indented,1

> How can I do those dynamic console outputs. Think of apt and like the logs at the top and keep the progress bar at the bottom@Deleted User the simplest way is to just use control characters like `\\r` and `\\b`,1

okay,0
i am working on number 4 i will send what i have so far my outcome and my desired outcome. i have asked a lot of people for help and they have told me to delete the break i have after == 10 but im not sure what to do after that,1
here is my code so far,0
alicecount = 0with open('alice.txt') as book: print('Enter word Alice:') for line in book: if Alice in line: alicecount += 1 print(line) if alicecount == 10: break if alicecount == 0: print('Not found'),1
this is my desired outcome,0
but this is the outcome i get. i need to have “392 lines contain Alice” but when i try adding something to count the lines it doesn’t work,1
because i need to only print the first 10 lines that contain alice,0
@Beebo it might be the line before.,0
@Beebo can you share the whole program?,0
,0
```pyalice_lines = [l for l in book if Alice in l]print(len(alice_lines))for line in alice_lines: print(line)```,0

I dont know about you guys but I have to remember that I cant type code into Discord. It will never be right unless I take extra time to review it.,1
I almost always need to run code because my tendency to make lapses mentally in what i typed and what i meant,1
for sure,0
@Bepis for me its not that I typed poorly its that my mind doesnt type what I thought I typed.,0
Its sort of like when you say someones elses name when talking about someone,0
But it happens when i type code in discord,0
If I open an editor and copy it its much better,0

@Mridul Javascript is what allows websites to be interactive for example the Discord client (both browser and standalone versions) are written in JavaScript. You can't use Python on the frontend (you can with brython but it's kind of a hack and you'll probably need JS anyway).Python and JavaScript work fine on the backend although I've never used JS on the backend. So it you want to work on the frontend use JS. Otherwise try both or flip a coin.,1
Learning two languages at the same time might not be the best idea for a beginner but you can try 🙂,1
Either Python or JS,0
@godlygeek :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```001 | a002 | b003 | c004 | a005 | b006 | c```,1

Honestly as a javascript developer I would recommend learning javascript. There are more python developers here who will recommend python. Either is fine they're both fun and intuitive languages with a lot of uses.,1

backend is what the client doesnt see it delivers content to the client,0
put simply the frontend is the code that runs on the user's computer and the backend is the code that runs on your server.,1
Front end is your food back end is your uber eats driver,0
so usually the backend is responsible for doing things that you don't want the user to have control over such as choosing what kinds of data the user has access to,1
do you want to have every facebook users stored in your browser @Mridul,0
> so usually the backend is responsible for doing things that you don't want the user to have control over such as choosing what kinds of data the user has access to@gm YES,1
then the frontend gets that data from the backend and displays it to the user.,0

you could theoretically have everything in the frontend but that means that anyone can access any part of your database.,0
well no,0

which is of course insecure but possible.,0

Well do use VS if you're developing for .NET,0
Unity? like the game engine?,0
"@namespace JS and Python are both compiled to bytecode the difference is that the JS bytecode is ran with a JIT compiler (which is not the same as compiling the language (e.g. the C compiler"") it\'s a runtime optimizer) so it\'s generally faster. A language being interpreted _and_ compiled leading to slowness is a strange statement 🙂",1
Unity and VS Code are nothing the same,0
You cant compare them,0
Ye,0
Unity is a game engine where scripts are typically made in C#. VS Code is a text editor for any language you can thing of. And you're not dumb you're just new,1
HTML and CSS are front end languages that go along with JS,0
Python has a JIT compiler (PyPy) but it's still on the 3.6 version and it doesn't have as much research put into it unlike JS,1
JS is the only language with a fully fleshed out JIT compiler. I wanna see PyPy running like JS does its just not there yet,1

does visual work for python??,0
@gm how about `klass`,0
Yes,0
STOP. 🛑,0
ok,0
@gm I have something even worse```pyclass Animal: @classmethod def from_string(класс string: str): ...```,0
Yes its entirely free its where I actually got started @Mridul,0
With both,0
@fix error what does `@classmethod` do?,0
not sure about C++ but I've seen `clazz` a fair bit in Java,0
ohhh,0
absolutely its way better than going through the process of reading docs all day and it teaches you how to integrate it into your html with demos too@Mridul,1
@apopathodiaphulatophobia the idea is that `klass`/`class`/`cls` can be used as an identifier where you need to say class because `class` is a keyword.,1
> @gm I have something even worse> ```py> class Animal:> @classmethod> def from_string(класс string: str):> ...> ```@fix error well all I can say is that the класс is not the only animal here,1

> We're talking about cases where you can't use the word `class` for a variable that is a class because `class` is a keyword in the language. So you use another name for that variable. Python traditionally goes with `cls`. C++ goes with `klass`. Apaparently Java goes with `clazz` sometimes though that one's new to me.@godlygeek I believe `cls` is preferred only for the first argument to class methods...?,1
if you have a normal argument and you want to use `class` it should be `class_`,0
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0008/#functionandmethodarguments,0
anyone: Which code editor should a beginner like me choose. I know a thing or two about python,0
> Always use cls for the first argument to class methods.> > If a function argument's name clashes with a reserved keyword it is generally better to append a single trailing underscore rather than use an abbreviation or spelling corruption. Thus class_ is better than clss. (Perhaps better is to avoid such clashes by using a synonym.),1
I try not to use either actually,0
because I think underscores in parameter names are icky,0
@apopathodiaphulatophobia Well for example you may want to pass a class to a function.,0
"!e```pyclass Animal: def __init__(self name age): self.name = name self.age = ageclass Duck(Animal): def quack(self): print(f""[{self.name}]: Quack!"")def create_animal(cls): # cls or class_ return cls(""joe 42)duck = create_animal(Duck)duck.quack()```",1

I never shadow builtins because it's a PyCharm warning that I don't want to turn off,0
on occasion it leads to weird names 🥴,0

it's a reference to the class that the method is called on,0

okay,0
^,0
i'm in #databases,0
which is why `__init__` is not alone a constructor,0
in the sense it is normally understoood,0
technically aren't most languages constructors just `__init__`?,0
and `__new__` isnt exposed?,0
> and `__new__` isnt exposed?@hmmm depends on the language.,0
> So we should use __new__@apopathodiaphulatophobia no use `__init__` unless you have a reason to do otherwise,0
`__new__` is for cases where you want to control the creation of instances. the most ubiquitous example is the singleton pattern I think,1
if you don't know if you should use `__new__` or not you probably shouldn't be using it,0

@Deleted User I supposed that it just shows you an example of how you can pass a function as an argument to another function.,1
oh that i understood thanks,0
it's a little lion 🦁,0
"@Deleted User Some people would say that functional programming is more about using pure functions  functions that don\'t depend on global state and don\'t mutate things. So instead of:```pyLOG = def double(x): LOG += f""doubling {x}...\"" return x  2```you can do:```pydef double(x): return (x  2 f""doubling {x}...\"")```which makes the functions easier to debug and test",1

"@VideoCarp Oh I understand. No you can\'t parametrize the import. The closest thing is that you can make a function inside a module.```py# module.pydef setup(variable=""Failed.""): print(variable) return 42# main.pyimport modulemodule = setup(""Success!"")```",1

Kivy is ui framework django and flask is web framework,0
> whats `__slots__` anyway@Deleted User basically classes use a `dict` to hold attributes so you can add new ones. if you define `__slots__` then you limit the attributes instances can have. this saves memory and is a bit faster.,1

@Fordcousin (GumChew) You can set GIT to ignore some files/directories look into this webpage: https://gitscm.com/docs/gitignore.,0
@Fordcousin (GumChew) You shouldn't put a virtual environment in a github repo. It contains systemspecific things and it's very large. You can make sure to instantiate the venv in the same version of Python on all devices and you can create a `requirements.txt` file and put all the dependencies there; then you can install them with `venv/bin/pip install r requirements`.,1

Termux is a great app you can have it running in the background but I wouldn't really recommend on hosting anything on your phone for obvious reasons.,1
It\'s pretty straightforward really Termux is a Linux environment so you can execute Linux commands in it start by giving the app the permission to read your file system execute the following commands in order:`termuxsetupstorage`  This will prompt you to give the Storage permissions.`pkg upgrade`  Updates all the packages installed in your environment.`pkg install python`  Installs Python and pip.Now install all the libraries you need and move into the folder where your bot files are in with `cd` command like: `cd storage/shared/bot` (Move into `storage/shared` if your primary storage is internal and not SD card.) and then run your bot with `python <filename>`.,1
Also to keep your Termux instance running in the background and prevent Android from shutting it down use `termuxwakelock`.,0

Okay,0
It's normal to have gaps in your knowledge. There's no reason to wait until you've completely mastered one topic before moving on to the next. Knowledge in different areas will complement each other and it will be hard to fully grasp OOP before applying it in practice often using different frameworks like Django for example.,1
Even professionals rarely fully master any one topic. You continue learning new things throughout your career.,0

@FLaDER i am too confused by the elements name help channels,0
@zien Alhaoushe It's not necessarily a matter of how many frameworks you know. The most important thing is understanding of the fundamentals of programming the web networking different types of tools like version control CI systems software project management processes how to effectively collaborate and communicate with other developers and stakeholders and to have experience with all of these things. If you can demonstrate that employers are generally willing to assume you will learn the specifics of whatever tech stack is used on the job. Good developers will usually pick up new libraries and frameworks pretty quickly. This is why it's important that you put your skills into practice with your own projects because it will teach you how to learn new skills when you need them. Which is something you will have to continue doing throughout your career.,1

@zien Alhaoushe That being said Python is mainly used for web backend development and data science/ML so it might not hurt to look into the major frameworks in those areas (depending on which you're most interested in working with).,1
@Deleted User In what way is it not working?,0
@dementati its hard to define it just does not work hiw its supposed to,0
"@Deleted User One issue is that when you try to set game_end in check_win() you use == instead of ="". == is equality and = is assignment so the latter is used for changing the value of a variable.",1

@Deleted User Can you describe what happens when you run it?,0
@appling no it just does not work how its supposed to,0
I get no error and when i try to win the filling up the first row it does nothing,0
@appling Not necessarily if it's a logic error.,0
Then the program will run and just not do what you want it to.,0
But in what else way do i create the logic??@dementati,0
@Deleted User Oh another thing you should be setting game_end to True in check_win not False.,0
It's already False.,0
Done but still does not work,0
@Deleted User Oh also you need to declare game_end as a global variable in check_win(),0
What's a one line solution for flipping a string? abc = cba,0
Otherwise Python will interpret it as a local variable,0
local variables only exist inside a given function,0
You can tell Python that a given variable is global by adding `global game_end` to the start of the function,0
@appling I think introducing classes is only going to confuse things at this point.,0
@dementati but i returned game end,0
how can i download some json data in my pc with python? what module should i use ?,0
@Deleted User Where?,0
Not in the snippet you sent before,0
After game_end is set to true after all the if conditions,0
Not in the snippet you posted,0
See: https://paste.pythondiscord.com/oxazelevec.py,0
This is what you posted and you're not returning game_end.,0
https://paste.pythondiscord.com/hovujojuwu.py,0
Alright updated code,0
@Deleted User Ok but you're not using the return value,0
the second one will only work on an int,0
but you probably meant `range(len(my_list))`,0
When you call check_win you have to assign the return value to something otherwise it will just be discarded,0
the first is preferable because you don't need to work with an int to get to the values,0
Alright thrn imma set it to global how do i do that can i just say gloabal at first decleration?@dementati,0
Just add `global game_end` to the start of the function,0
Then any subsequent references to game_end will refer to the global variable instead of a local one.,0
At th start of a fumction?,0
At the start of check_win,0
Ok,0
@𝔹𝕒𝕕𝕞𝕒𝕤𝕙 range(my_list) is probably not correct,0
Yesss it workssss@dementati :arrowright: :cutie: :Arrowlcolor:,0

"```pythonimport mathnumber_to_check = int(input(""Enter which number you want to know prime of \""))is_prime = Truefor i in range(2 math.sqrt(int(number_to_check)) + 1): if number_to_check % i == 0: is_prime: False breakif is_prime: reply = The number is prime!""else: reply = The number is not prime""print(reply)```@dementati",1
this is the exact code our teacher taught us,0
`sqrt` returns a float,0
@Ping for toast what do u mean,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan using a single araay with value 1 to 9,0
0 to 8 rather,0
> `sqrt` returns a float@✪ SavagePastaMan what should i do to fix it?,0
@Torment (Matured Pokermon) math.sqrt will return a float.,0
you need to swap the order from `math.sqrt(int(number_to_check))` to `int(math.sqrt(number_to_check))`,0
Since roots can be both integers and decimal values.,0
you want to turn the result of sqrt to an int,0
@SIVAZLAYICI read the !paste above,0
@Torment (Matured Pokermon) And you can't use a float in range(),0
@Deleted User yeah i think a 2D list is more intuitive in that situation,0
> @Torment (Matured Pokermon) And you can't use a float in range()@dementati welp it worked for the one who was screensharing,1
Interestingly accelerators problem is not easily solved. This is the entire basis for the security of public key cryptography with RSA:,1
Decrypting RSA requires factorizing a very large integer.,0
if `Num` is small a naive method should be good enough,0
Right.,0
can't you use the `max` builtin,0
@Niksen this is it,0
this is what the teacher showed us and it worked,0
@Torment (Matured Pokermon) It should never work. The person screensharing might have done something subtly different.,0
no,0
its a screenshot from their screen,0
@Torment (Matured Pokermon) Yeah they are casting the result of math.sqrt to an integer.,0
Which you didn't do.,0
huh how do i do it then,0
@Torment (Matured Pokermon) did you read my message i pointed out your problem and how to fix it,0
@Niksen no. #discordbots,0
ahh i realized that i put the int in the wrong place,0
> you need to swap the order from `math.sqrt(int(number_to_check))` to `int(math.sqrt(number_to_check))`> you want to turn the result of sqrt to an int,1
You use the int() function to convert a float to an int,0
yeah thanks a lot guys,0
read closely many bugs are like this,0
what does `functools.wraps` or `wraps` in general do>,0
here?,0
ohh ok @Qwerty why would we want to do that?,0
why would I?,0
@pratt don't you just need the 3 largest numbers?,0
the largest number from multiplying will be from multiplying the largest 2 ints right,0
> When decorating a function you replace the function with a different function@Qwerty huh replace?,0
prime factorize `Num`,0
@IamKraZ®™ you can show your work in this channel,0
then you're done right?,0
don't you have that?,0
@IamKraZ®™ If you have questions about the community itself such as what channel you should use for different purposes you can also ask in #communitymeta which is usually not as active as this one.,1
why not `2  3  5`?,0
@IamKraZ®™ You can post your project on r/madeinpython,0
hmm,0
k,0
@Skott Nope sorry.,0
@Qwerty ohh it gave it's name as the wrapper why is that?,0
when?,0
right,0

ohh ok so it's for getting the information about the function that's being decorated,0
I have an idea of creating logic i can check with a 2d listIf the first paramter is 0 through 2 and all the second paramter is same then i can end or second paramter is 0 through 2 and fall first paramter is same then also i can end,1
Btw if you dont know what i am talking about i am trying to create a tic tac toe logic with a 2d list,1
@Deleted User Sounds like a good approach.,0
That way you will cover everything except the diagonals.,0
And you can handle those separately.,0
Since there are only two.,0
Ya i can do that manutally too@dementati,0
Yep,0
@SnowyOxygen You want to draw a circle on a 2D grid of cells?,0
One simple approach would be to iterate over all cells and for each cell check if its distance from the center is equal to the radius of the circle.,1
@SnowyOxygen Instead of calculating the euclidean distance you could use the manhattan distance.,0
Manhattan distance is very simple,0
Why wont this work??```\tfor i in range(2):\t\tfor a in range(2):\t\t\tif board[i][a] == X':\t\t\t\tgame_end = True```,0
@SnowyOxygen https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry,0
@SnowyOxygen This will ensure that the distance metric you get is an integer.,0
Vscode is good for beginners?,0
So it will clearly be either exactly the radius or not.,0
Have you guys had any experience with faang interviews,0
@takayan Refrain from selfadvertising,0
With this logic it only ends game when i say 1234 not on 123 ```\ti = 0\ta = 0\twhile i != 3:\t\ti += 1\t\twhile a != 3:\t\t\tif board[i][a] == X':\t\t\t\tgame_end = True\t\t\ta += 1```,1
@Deleted User First of all since you know the number of iterations required you should use a for loop and not a while loop.,1
@dementati alright but what should be the condition??,0
@Deleted User Also you're incrementing i at the beginning of the loop instead of the end so board[0][a] is never checked.,1
Ooo i see@dementati,0
@TrueDarkness It's a twodimensional data structure,0
So they do need two nested loops,0
Sooo what should be my for loop condition??? For i in range(2):For a in range(2):Board[i][a]???,0
How do u route a number in python?,0
You root???@Inheritance ♦,0
@Deleted User With range(x) x is noninclusive so range(3) gives 0 1 2,0
`√`,0
So it should be `for i in range(3):`,0
ohh,0
I need help anyone has done Deep Neural Network Before and is a Pro like OG pro,0
@Sonsonroro17 ask in #datascienceandai,0
But i dont want to make it soo that anyone is true but instead all should be true,0
@Deleted User You can create a new bool flag for each inner loop and set it to True initially then if any of the values inside are either unset or set to the opponent color then you set it to False.,1
That way it will only remain True if all values are the right color,0
sup,0
how y'all py's doing,0
:YBlol:,0
what can i make with python,0
@Deleted User You could also do this: `game_end = all(board[i][a] == X for a in range(3))`,0
Visual studio code is good for python beginners?,0
I have pycharm too,0
😮,0

hi,0
:PogChamp:,0
What do you mean for them to both be as close as 0 as possible?,0
If N1 is smaller N2 is bigger.,0
If they want for them to be as close to each other as possible then you must pick the numbers closest to the square root of `Num`.,1
"That\'s why I said closest to the square root"".",0
All prime numbers are integers 🙂,0
"I\'m not sure what you mean by when I will do 100 = max(50,2)  it will become 50 and it will take more steps to reach 0"".",1
What do you mean by `Num = max(N1 N2)`?,0
Do you want to pick two numbers N1 and N2 so that `N1  N2 = Num` and `max(N1 N2)` has the smallest possible value?,1
Accept a string from user and change first letter of every word to capital. In case any other letters are capital  they must change to smallEg a wOLf in jungLE. Must change to A Wolf In Jungle.,1
Well then you need exacty what I said: you need to pick the numbers closest to the square root.Suppose that `N1 = sqrt(Num)` and `N2 = sqrt(Num)`. `N1  N2` is of course `Num`. If you decrease one number the other increases so `sqrt(Num) sqrt(Num)` is the optimal value.,1
HELP,0
python is kinda hard,0
@Watashi One way to do that is to first turn all letters to the lower case and then capitalize all the words. You can find about out the needed methods here use the method names as hints and read the description to make sure: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#stringmethods>,1
NaBro,0
i cant use all thos,0
i have to use for and if,0
idk C lang,0
i m total NOOB,0
@𝔹𝕒𝕕𝕞𝕒𝕤𝕙 ```py else: upper.append(letter)```should be `lower.append(letter)`,0
@eivl I don't think that's the solution> > Do you want to pick two numbers `N1` and `N2` so that `N1  N2 = Num` and `max(N1 N2)` has the smallest possible value?> yes exactly this,1
@appling Nope,0
@𝔹𝕒𝕕𝕞𝕒𝕤𝕙 You could just count upper or lower tho,0
Then do len(string)  upper_or_lower,0
@pratt Might be a bit faster tho,0
we since we don't access second variable each iteration,0
!projects @CumSock You can check out this page.,0
,0
@pratt Might? I'm sure it's O(1),0
@𝔹𝕒𝕕𝕞𝕒𝕤𝕙 In re `import` and modules: https://python.swaroopch.com/modules.html,0
`len` is O(1) on strings,0
wdym why ? that's how it is,0
that book is specifically aimed at beginners,0
yes and strings store their sizes,0
🙂,0
```c#define _PyUnicode_UTF8_LENGTH(op) \\ (((PyCompactUnicodeObject)(op))>utf8_length)```,0
it just gets the length attribute,0
it's helpful to have the context when needed.,0
@pratt Strings store their length. They're not 0terminated. In fact they can contain null bytes _and_ null characters (which may differ in unicode).,1
How do I make a python Module from another language?,0
yes it does it when the string is built,0
@Deleted User the other language needs to be able to expose a C API to do that. it's relatively easy to write Python extensions in C or C++,1
like almost every single language out there,0
> @Deleted User the other language needs to be able to expose a C API to do that. it's relatively easy to write Python extensions in C or C++@Infinimata can I create a c# module?,1
"@pratt What do you mean by traverse the string once""? How else would you know the length of a unicode string?",1
@Deleted User if it exposes a C API.,0
> @Deleted User if it exposes a C API.@Infinimata Does it expose the c api?,0
idg your point then python does it like c++ like java like c# etc,0
@Deleted User I don't know. Someone with C# experience would be better to ask,0
Alright,0
Well anyway `len` is `O(1)`,0
@pratt This is faster though```pydef upper_lower_count(string): upper_count = sum(1 for c in string if c.isupper()) return upper_count len(string)  upper_count```,0
that doesn't change the fact that it runs in constant time,0
Python is a lot slower than C++. That's not a secret 🙂,0
the question is whether Python is fast enough for a given job including human time.,0
@pratt That's generally because C++ compiles to a native binary whereas Python compiles to interpreted bytecode.,0
you can always bring in C/C++ modules for raw computational speed when needed.,0
C/C++/Rust 🙂,0
anything that exposes a C compatible API yes,0
@appling `filter`,0
@pratt You're right that you shouldn't generally rely on Python for highperformance code but that doesn't mean you should disregard performance entirely when writing Python.,1
there's no reason to study the standard library unless you need to use it,0
...but how do you know whether you need to use it unless you know what's in it? 🤔,0
You can skim through it to see what's generally in there.,0
fine know a little bit about each module but you don't need to know everything does until you need it,0
I don't usually go browsing the standard library docs for fun either.,0
the best way to learn this stuff is to take on a project and then see what in the standard library might be of use in it.,1
(or what in other libraries might be of use by searching PyPI),0
When I need something I google it and occasionally I'll start remembering what's in different standard library modules or see something else that I might need.,1
i can't read,0
I like video better,0
There are so many good free resources online I don't think it's generally worth it to pay for a Python course.,1
It's kind of hard to explain a huge chunk of code in a book,0
What I did was just learn through projects,0
@Deleted User You can do both. Read books and do projects.,0
,0
videos help me more than books,0
reading and working on projects both help but projects really cement your understanding in a way reading alone can't,0
just my preference,0
Videos are fine too.,0
> reading and working on projects both help but projects really cement your understanding in a way reading alone can't@Infinimata yes,1
because then you have a living incarnation of the ideas you're trying to pick up,0
There are several really good video series on Youtube too.,0
There is cjog I think was the name. He has tutorials for python I have been following it. So far I'm understanding some of it.,1
@Ilmangamer `os.sep` is the path separator for whatever operating system the script is running on like `\\`. The `+`s concatenates a strong from all the things between them,1
"@Ilmangamer `""a + b + c""` yields `""abc""`",0
That's not the best way to concatenate strings in Python though but it's one way,0
hi,0
im trying to make a thing where it converts letters into ascii and then into a string,0
@Ilmangamer You can use `pathlib` to work with paths and files,0
@Deleted User wdym?...,0
`pathlib` is recommended for paths whenever possible yes,0
like you type in a and it comes up with 97,0
"```py>>> ord(""A"")65```",0
```py>>> chr(65)'A'```,0
but if u typed a + b it would com up with 97 + b,0
ok i kinda getit,0
You need to convert first letter or what?,0
it converts a string of letters,0
into the ascii values,0
ok,0
```ord(c)Given a string representing one Unicode character return an integer representing the Unicode code point of that character. For example ord('a') returns the integer 97 and ord('€') (Euro sign) returns 8364. This is the inverse of chr().```@ayythelegend is right,1
ok,0
"> ```python> name = input(""Name: )> age = int(input(""Age: ))> last = input(""Last Name: )> > print(""Name: name Age: age Last Name: last)> > if age > 18:> print(""You are over 18 years old!"")> elif age < 18:> print(""You are under 18 years old!"")> else:> print(""You are 18!"")> > def func():> if name == Mike"":> return You are Mike!""> if not name == Mike"":> print(""You are not mike!"")> > print(func())> ``` why does it say None at the end of the debug?@AXED i have no idea thats wiered",1
@Silent Killer there's not really much point is there?,0
Python makes a point of code being readable so trying to cram too much into one line just defeats its purpose,1
what's your real goal?,0
"if you `return print(""Hi"")` the function will return `None` but you\'ll print `Hi` to the console",0
`print` always returns `None`,0
what does unexpected EOF while parsing mean,0
@Deleted User it means the script you wrote has a syntax error most likely,0
ok,0
"return hello""; print(""hello"")",0
@Pedro. that won't work,0
`return` immediately ends execution when it's encountered,0
oh true,0
print needs to be first then,0
"if you want to return something that\'s also printed just do this```pyresult = Done""print (result)return result```",0
or `print` whatever's returned as in the code above,0
how do you do an input again,0
ok thx,0
"x = (input(""input:"")print(ord(x))when i do this it says invalid syntax",0
oh yeah,0
ord() wont convert a string of two or more. how do i change it so it does,0

@Aboo Minister What library are you using? Can you paste your code?,0
@croag doesn't that cause a naming issue?,0
i wanna help with the Python Help: Occupied but they are showing way too complicated stuff,0
Wait no that just returns the same thing,0
I believe so yeah,0
@croag show your code,0
@Aboo Minister I'm not familiar with that library sorry... Maybe you can turn on some debug flag in the parser? Anyway I'll take a look and see.I personally would recommend `lark` for parsing. It's very easy to use and very powerful.,1
well it should change @croag,0
"@croag ```pyif __name__ == \'__main__\': auth = Authorization() print(auth.auth_code) auth.set_code(""abc"") print(auth.auth_code)>> None>> abc```",0
what?,0
well you're creating new Authorization object,0
They do not share state,0
@Aboo Minister Your lexer is ignoring `[ \\t\\r\\f\\v]+` but not newline characters.,0
```pyauth_code = request.args.get('code')auth = Authorization()auth.set_code(auth_code)skip = auth.next_song()return skip```@croag,0

like here is this list required?,0
no,0
i want it to print a message when a color is typed in,0
@Deleted User You could make your code shorter though,0
```pyalien_colors = {'green': 5 yellow': 10 red': 15}color = yellow'if color in alien_colors: print(f'You have just earned {alien_colors[color]} points.')```,0
@CodeRxJesseJ We aren't gonna solve problems for you,0
🤔,0
Yeah what you want then?,0
do they have same length?,0
why are you reversing your numbers?,0
@CodeRxJesseJ Also you can just convert string to list via `list()`,0
can you show me example output? @CodeRxJesseJ,0
@CodeRxJesseJ so for example,0
if n1 = 090'n2 = 191'it should print 10?,0
How is it same at 10th and 1st?,0
does any have experience in discord.py and is willing to help me fix my commands im sure its a simple fix and im dumb as usual,1
@CodeRxJesseJ It's used for string formatting.,0
yea i did im just wanted other people to see it,0
"@CodeRxJesseJ `""%s %d % (some_str some_int)` < This will create a string with %s and %d replaced with the values of some_str and some_int respectively",1
"!e ```pysome_str = foo""some_int = 23print(""%s %d % (some_str some_int))```",0
@dementati :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```foo 23```,0
```pyn1 = 0900'n2 = 1211'for i (num1 num2) in enumerate(zip(reversed(n1) reversed(n2))): if num1 == num2: print(f'Numbers are same at position {10  i} num1 num2) if all(a != b for a b in zip(n1 n2)): print('No numbers are the same')```@CodeRxJesseJ I would solve it that way though but it depends on number length,1
It does,0
So you should use .format or fstrings rn,0
There are several ways to format strings in Python,0
% is kinda old and hard to read,0
The % method was mainly used before fstrings were introduced.,0
What about `.format` tho?,0
@xtremedevx crypto hashing,0
I think fstrings are usually the right approach since you can see in context what will be injected.,0
@dementati You can use them in some cases though,0
But usually they're the best method,0
@xtremedevx hah,0
Nope,0
I think they should be the default.,0
@xtremedevx You can\'t unhash something in reasonable amount of time,0
Except you got supercomputer or something,0
@xtremedevx If db is stored locally does it matter?,0
@xtremedevx You need API then,0
Don't give your users db access,0
@xtremedevx Are you talking about storing users passwords in a database or are you talking about the admin password used to access the database?,1
I think the second one,0
You generally want to read secrets such as db passwords from environment variables in your code.,0
Then when you run the app locally you can just supply it directly.,0
@dementati I mean he wanted to connect to db on another server from user's apps,0
And that's a bad way to do that,0
And when you deploy it for production you can feed them in via a CI system securely.,0
Like gui app or something,0
If I understand correctly you should not access a database directly from a user client.,0
^,0
The client should talk to a backend service via an API and the backend service should access the database.,0
@adi. It's python server tho,0
What do you have done so far?,0
@2fat4chair at least try to solve it first 🙂,0
@2fat4chair You have to ask for price/hr and duration of a work,0
duration and how many hrs are basically the same,0
your logic is kinda messed up,0
@2fat4chair```pyhourly_rate = float(input('Enter price/hr: ))duration_hours = int(input('How long will it take(hours): ))if duration_hours > 2: print(2  hourly_rate + (duration_hours  2)  hourly_rate / 2)else: print(duration_hours  hourly_rate)```,1
use `````pythonYour Code Here`````,0
!codeblock,0
,0
```pyhourly_rate = float(input('Enter price/hr: ))duration_hours = int(input('How long will it take(hours): ))print(2  hourly_rate + max(duration_hours  2 0)  hourly_rate / 2)```,0
with 3 `,0

you could just type py,0
then press enter and paste your code,0
and end with 3x `,0

Hey guys I have some code I\'m stuck on how to make it involves Ifthen statements. Here is the prompt: A vending machine serves chips fruit nuts juice water and coffee. The machine owner wants a daily report indicating what items sold that day. Given boolean values (1 or 0) indicating whether or not at least one of each item was sold (in the order chips fruit nuts juice water and coffee) output a list for the owner. If all three snacks were sold output Allsnacks instead of individual snacks. Likewise output Alldrinks if appropriate. For coding simplicity output a space after every item including the last item. The output wants to be like this: For example if the input was,1
not in it.You could use `from __future__ import annotations` tho,0
0 0 1  1 0 then it would print out Nuts and Juice,0
...,0
@Ethan//mystic That's pretty easy tho. You have to know how to work with if statements and probably loops,0
@ToxicWildcard put that line at the top of your file.,0
Yeah my trouble is basically with having it print out only the ones that have sold,0
Show us your code then,0
Like I can get it to print out the ones that sold but for the ones that haven't I've tried print() but it makes a space,1
chipsSold = int(input())fruitSold = int(input())nutsSold = int(input())juiceSold = int(input())waterSold = int(input())coffeeSold = int(input())if ChipsSold ==1: print('Chips') if fruitSold ==1: print('Fruit') if nutsSold ==1: print('Nuts') if juiceSold ==1: print('Juice') if waterSold ==1: print('Water') if coffeeSold ==1: print('Coffee'),1
Hey @Ethan//mystic!,0
That's not really a way to do that,0
What should my approach be?,0
I could show you my solution and then you could figure out how it works,0
If you'd like,0
I'll take any help I can get,0
After this do you have any suggestions on getting some more learning on loops/if statements,0
does anyone know how to make a python folder?,0
ye,0
no a python text file,0
yeah,0
@Ethan//mystic ```pyflags = input() # Must have length of 6products = ['Chips Fruit Nuts Juice Water Coffee']products = [products[i] for i flag in enumerate(flags) if flag == 1']print( .join(products))```,1

how i created a simpe text file but i dont see an option for a py file.,0
Change it's extension,0

Is that an okay way to use trycatch blocks? I don't think I've ever seen them used like that in any languageAlso I would personally have `Http_Status = True` before the try catch blocks,1
oh,0
It may work in Python but does it work on other languages? I dunno it just seems weird to me,0
I am new to python XD,0
It in fact be perfectly fine :lemon_thinking:,0
NP. I rarely use it and am afraid of its oddities hence being so unsure,0
`try/except` should always catch as narrow a range of errors as possible,0
try and except is cool,0
and very useful,0
swallowing all errors with `except:` is not a good idea as it can smother errors that you want to know about.,1
good point,0
yeah but idk how to make it so it just trap 1 error or 2,0
you trap based on the type of exception e.g.```pyexcept IndexError:# or...except (IndexError TypeError):```,0
Oh,0
that way you can focus the error trapping as closely as possible and then ideally find out how to avoid having them raised at all.,1
Sooo how do I change the extension @Adams Jacob,0
I tried doing the save as thing and renaming but it didn’t do anything,0

That didn’t work for me...I named the folder bot.py.Do I name it bot? Then add the py?,0
Hmm i was thinking return allows it to pass down it does not work?,0
Lol I’m naming a file,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx when you call `Http` you return three values which you are then saving into a single variable as a tuple. You want to save the results into three variables,1
how do i do that?,0
i've never used return,0
@! xXKiller_BOSSXx `Trackinfo Lyricsinfo Http_Status = Http()`,0
@croag what do u need with json?,0
ohh,0
otherwise all three values are being packed into a tuple,0
@Akarsh01 but doesn’t it have to show the little python logo if it’s a python file,0
@croag are u able to show me the json?,0
use pyinstaller,0
@Gaarbra The most common reasons why PyInstaller packaged apps don't work is because some thirdparty dependency wasn't automatically packaged with it.When you first run PyInstaller on a project it generates a .spec file that's in your projects root directory. With that you can customize future runs of PyInstaller to do things like include imports that it doesn't detect properly.https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/specfiles.htmlThat doc goes into how spec files can be generated reused edited etc. They're the key to making PyInstaller work right.I'd als recommend using PyInstaller without the `onefile` option because otherwise it makes debugging difficult until you get everything running.It also helps to compile apps with the console enabled and to run the resulting .exe from the command line so you can see any error output printed to the console. This includes things like potential missing imports or other files that weren't bundled with the app.,1
so yes? Or no,0
So if it doesn’t have the python logo on the file is it a py file or nah,0

Hey does anyone know how to make a button that says hello when you press it,0
i use vscode,0
its good for python and other languages,0
I'm making a rhythm game and so the game buttons are very simple. They only carry a few pieces of information and their only real behavior is to move from one end of the screen to anotherBecause their position is strictly increasing in one axis and constant in the other the only functionality they've been given is a simple step function that keeps keeps count of how many frames they've been moving. Note that I I use the factory pattern to create all of my UI elementsThe issue lies if someone changes the screen size during gameplay. The renderer handles all of the drawing stuff so it doesn't make sense to let it change any values. That's where the issues comes in,1
What is the `correct` of doing this in OOP? There's a ton of ways to solve this problem... I can use different classes from the button and just add an extra field for the rail info (inheritance),1
sublime is very fast already with any decent computer it's already faster than you need,0
Cool. Is that hte right way to do it? What about updating the axes though? Who's in charge of that? The button? Or am I supposed to copy over the existing button data and create new objects with the factory methods?,1
Etc etc. Who controls what?,0
But who's in charge of making any necessary adjustments to the buttons?They can do it... just use a static variable in the settings object and run `Settings.were_coordinates_changed()` and then have each button update themselves,1
,0
,0
So then what you're saying is... ```pyclass LinearButton: self._rail: Rail self.steps: int = 0class OtherButton: self.coordinate: Coordinate``` and have the function that does care about settings do```pyif isinstance(obj LinearButton): ... translate linear coordinates ...elif isinstance(obj OtherButton): ... translate other coordinates ......```?,1
(Not sure about the order of `isinstance` jut took a guess there),0
ok,0
Ugh. Time to learn all that design pattern stuff,0
The Big Four? The Four A's? Whatever it was,0

thanks I will look,0
so if anyone would want to help me just ping me here,0
what is this for? why can't you just call the method normally?,0
@IIIIIIIIIIIllllllllllllllIIIIlll dont do that at the beginning you should do something more easy like making a GUI or working with data,1
inline if statement or ternary are probably the most common @Defxult,0
ternary implies a 3components element that'd be `x if y else z`,0
@Defxult Yes whichever value is truthy.,0
There's no special syntax in that case `or` is just an operator like `+`.,0
ah yeah you're right my bad,0
With a slight difference  if a truthy value is found the rest of the expressions are not evaluated,0

It can also be really expensive though... if you're enrolled at a university they may have a student license you can use,1
doesnt show the reordering just False,0
NP,0
ah okay got it,0
so I think you probably want a `for` loop here,0
1 sec gotta google that to understand,0
and the logic should be something like: for every character:  if alpha add to `alphas`  if number add to `numbers`  else return `False` join `alphas` and `numbers`,1
Octave is the free and open source version of MATLAB. Maybe starting with Python to build up your programming skills is a better use of time than jumping into one of those more unconventional languages,1
not really unconventional; more specialised,0
thats a better logic ty,0
ill try it out and see ill let you know in a few minutes,0

it's not very intuitive.,0
but it is helpful if you like this kind of thing,0
I don't like them. I've argued against it too many times though. I don't think anyone is changing their mind,0
I personally don't really use them because I prefer being explicit (so `if`expressions instead),0
it can lead to logic errors.,0
in particular when valid input is falsey.,0
Actually one sec,0
I came back to Python yesterday and was already adding my own type stuff in,0

but you're not talking specifics which are very important here.,0
what is the mathematical approach you want to take?,0
> @gm `something` could be optional or it could be anything where its lack of presence is in some way Falsy which usually means None yes@Flash. so what if `None` means no value use default but a falsey value (say `\'\'`) is also appropriate?,1
that's the main reason I don't use them,0
> I've used it when iterating between 2 different lists but never besides that@D. 🔮 think about how you can use `zip` to compare an element and the one after it,1
> @gm obv you cant use it if a falsey input is valid@Flash. which is my point. it's generally clearer to use an `if`expression IMO,1
Wouldn't zip create extra lists? I think `all e in list == first item` would allow for short circuiting,0
because using `and`/`or` in that way is also less readable.,0

> Ill read the documentation on that if I find some@Snags http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/projects/air/publications/zhang2018siamese.pdf this definitely looks relevant,0
that was an example,0
it doesn't exist.,0
if you don't think you have the time/dedication to do research and write your own neural network,0
I suggest you just try looking around on Google for a library that can do that out of the box,0
I'm sure one exists (it might not use DL but it should exist),0
If you want the easy way to compare two lists just use:```pyfor i in len(songA): if not songA[I] == songB[I]: add a zero somewhere else: add a 1 somewhere```,1
I would recommend against that method though,0
no it's actually harder than using zip,0

short questions yes,0
Well my python works,0

what version of py,0
3.9.0,0
,0
Hmm,0
`pip3`?,0
there's a chance that your module doesn't support 3.9,0
wait my vscode python extension says 3.8.3 and cmd says 3.8.5,0
try downgrading to 3.8 or even 3.7,0
Try using a venv,0
As a best practice,0
pip3 doesnt work either,0
Well the thing is.... when i tested the pip install it said the pip is not a inside command,0
~~||when in doubt sudo it out||~~,0
> is it on path?@Pedro.,0
||actually don't||,0
@Deleted User paste your error message here,0
arg this is so annoying,0
just use 3.8 has much better support,0
Forget that Python 2 even exists unless you have no choice,0
just use 3.8 lol,0
buncha cool libs need time to support 3.9,0
for instance tf only does 3.53.8 atm,0
I think Python 2 is no longer even supported. You will likely never need to use it unless you are really really unlucky,1
"> @Deleted User paste your error message here@エニラ i will soon,it will take while since my computer is in another language",1
what language would that be,0
But even then it's honestly not too hard to just keep a list of changes nearby,0
i remember waiting for months to get my dependencies updated for py 3.7,0
> what language would that be@Zenny portuguese,0
そうか,0
@Shahprogrammer just upgraded both but same error as before,0
post it here anyways,0
google translate exists,0
im portuguese,0
oh,0
Oh,0
@Mito do cd ~/ and run it,0
use o google tradutor para traduzir a mensagem de erro @Deleted User,0
> @Shahprogrammer just upgraded both but same error as before@Mito That's not an error,0
yeah ik,0
it's a warning and doesn't matter since you'll not be using `easy_install` anyway,0
use `nowarnscriptlocation`,0
the last one,0
Honestly 3.8.whatever_is_currently_on_the_download_page,0
3.8.6,0
The error is ´´'python is not recognized as an internal or external command an operable program or a batch file´´,0
3.9 is probably getting some new features. When it comes out you can read the change log and decide if you want to upgrade or not,1
Well i had 3.8.5 before oof,0
Did you add it to your `PATH`?,0
I uninstalled the 3.8.5 version,0
EnvPath on Windows? Did you restart afterwards?,0
Installing 3.8.5 may have overwritten the environment to stop pointing to 3.5,0
Uninstalling 3.8.5 might have then deleted that variable leaving you with no references to Python in there,0
So what i should do,0
Reinstall the version you want to use,0
Or just add it to your path if it's 3.5 and that's still installed,0
Don't get it from the MS Store... supposedly there's something bad with that version?,0
what is win.fill ? i tried googling it and didnt get any results,0
Are modules updated in 3.8.6 version yet?,0
is there way to fix this? i always happen when i spam the action i am guessing due to the delay with http requests,1
wdym?,0
oh,0
@bigbotpein like this?,0
Thx,0
i was gonna use sleep() lol,0
> @Mito have you upgraded pip?@Shahprogrammer yes i have tried a lot such as user running as administrator etc,0
i got it to work in cmd but not its just not working in game windows,0
well i uninstalled python 3.9 and the launcher,0
@Dip got the same error after i spam the actions,0
i am installing the 3.8.5 again,0
pyautogui is working perfectly fine but when I open a game and call the click function it doesnt do anything,0
but if i use the click function anywhere else it works,0
,0
Hmm so what should i do?,0
basily like when server spamming the data then this happends,0
so is possble to fix this error then?,0
what is whitespace?,0
space newline tab vertical tab form feed,0
oh,0
what's the json look like,0
Hmm so it seems like the server can't send data in between 1s so each command has to 1s before next command or else it gives this error,1
uh,0
i could make it trap the error but then the action wouldnt run,0
just ask your question,0
does python takes a lot of time to install?,0
plenty of people here know pandas,0
i uninstalled the launcher,0
It should be relatively quick,0
how long is it taking you,0
i needed to re install the 3.8.5,0
minutes,0
but i need the server to run and send command that fast,0
unless it's because this ifs,0
like alot of ifs,0
oh now its installing,0
now i can see the green color,0
so should i just make it so when ever it that error it will just pass it?,0

D: i've been looking for that fix for like over 2hrs now,0
Should i just use sleep()?,0
or use error trap? like try/except?,0
or maybe instand of use json.loads use find?,0
Today i learned about assert,0
Wish I'd known this a while ago. Would have saved me so much time when debugging.,0
7 minutes without a message... totally normal..,0
So i removed json.loads() and it my server is able to spam sending,0
is it because loading it as json is slow?,0
idk,0
https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/770115767910924318,0
look in that i get error about json when i spam that,0
json.decoder.JSONDecodeError,0
that's the error i get,0
any idea what i should do?,0
Hmm,0
but here is the thing if i dont spam the action it doesnt give me that error but once i spam it then it gives the error,1
and the data is the same,0
so how do i fix that issue?,0
I dont want to convert into a string,0
Hmm can it still load in json?,0
,0
that's what the data look like,0
```json{'data': [{'id': PlayPause value': Play'}] pluginId': YoutubeMusic actionId': Play/Pause type': action'}```,0
what is it called when you change the resolution of something,0
i am trying to find something in the ffmpeg doc but im not sure whats it called,0
hmm,0
yeah...,0
but i can't change that because the server is from a program,0
but when i load in json it works,0
this json is a message that the program send to me when i do a action in the program,0
,0
The Program called TouchPortal it's like a stream deck,0
so when i press a button it does a action but i am making a plugin for it,0
maybe i can use replace,0
and replace all the \ with,0
@Night Fury no,0
what's the context,0
nope it doesnt work also it seems like when json.loads() it replaces back from  to \,0
,0
the first one is the one that i replaced \ to  then loaded in json but then it changed from  to \,1
,0
does this work?,0
wdym you dont know the context @Night Fury,0
where did you find that,0
find what?,0
,0
just say your question,0
any idea? even tho i putted in a array,0
@vanii We had power and water before the internet,0
Hmm is there better way? like when the json is ready then load the next data and go on,0
any idea?,0
@vanii I'm like 99.9% power plants and water plants have solid backup systems that don't rely on the internet,0
I mean it's still a great question to get answered. Because knowing all the stuff that's happened in 2020 I wouldn't be surprised if the power did go out if the internet hypothetically crashed.,1

@Avangunite you can use `__file__` to find the current scripts location,0

> I'm trying to pull a value from cur.fetchall but it claims it's not subscriptable@Saltstorm whats the entire error and which lib are you using,1
or is that even possible,0
!resources,0
,0
hum since I just need to run a curl command perhaps I should use a shell script instead,0
it looks like keyboard module should work,0
I can just set it to ~ or something,0
this is a one time thing to abuse a discord bot,0
Dont ask for help for that,0
abuse,0
aboose,0
are you trying to make a macro to self bot,0
... sorta. Im hotkeying delete message,0
thats not really self bot since its still one user action to one discord action,0
Selfbot,0
that sounds like selfbotting to me,0
why dou you even need to do this in the first place,0
tbh idk,0
am bored,0
Make a regular bot that has a really short command that deletes your latest message. Would act like a slightly longer hotkey,1
Why selfbot,0
ffs,0
its a keyboard macro,0
So,0
so the day discord formally bans keyboard macros let me know,0
If youre doing it through a selfbot thats already banned,0
it in no way interacts directly with the discord api,0
im not,0
A setter is a function to set a property,0
^,0
> it in no way interacts directly with the discord api@Deleted User oh then thats fine,0
thank you,0
that's still selfbotting,0
even if it doesn't use the api,0
Preferably return nothing,0
hum... keyboard module requires root,0
what type of setter,0
does it actually do checks,0
or anything other than just `self.var = var`,0
implicit return none,0
Returning wont do anything,0
A setter is just setting a property to some value,0
you don't need a return statement,0
since it'll return none by default,0
Your function and argument names are the same,0
Change it,0
wtf I pressed ctrl shift v and now my pointer is weird,0
and I cant click anything...,0
wtf did I do lol,0
> can you please tell me why == is use@Moodudu to compare,0
is vs ==?,0
is checks identity,0
== checks equality,0
"like [1,2] is [1,2]",0
is false,0
"```py>>> 1 == 1True>>> 3 == 2False>>> me == you""False```",0
"but [1,2] == [1,2] is true",0
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/132988/isthereadifferencebetweenandis,0
```py>>> a = 5>>> print(a)5```,0
let me give u an example,0
What,0
no it's for identity checks,0
age = 19print(age < 21) this is an example of a conditional test,0
that's because none is a singleton value,0
== is important,0
`a=5;b=a;a is b` is true,0
For instance,0
Me when I started programming: omggg there's a library for everything kxzhelwtMe now: I've been browsing github for 13 days now. I found 3 libraries. All of them are deprecated.,1
> pretty sure `is` is for comparing type.@VideoCarp `is` is for comparing identity and two identical objects must have the same type.,1
but really the only common use of `is` I can think of is to compare to `None`,0
> `is` is used in the sentinal pattern@Flash. yup fair enough,0
> so like it is to compare int to an int?@vinam `is` is used to check if two objects are the same thing,1
`==` is used to check if two objects have the same value,0
Anyone got raw SQL string management tips,0
no,0
`isinstance` is for checking types,0
like is this object an `int`?,0
`is` is more like...,0
this object is a thing in memory. this other object is another thing in memory. are the two the same thing in memory?,1
no,0
wups,0
the rest is correct but no `is` is not about comparing types,0
> `a is b` is basically just a nice way of writing `id(a) == id(b)`@Flash. this is what you should focus on IMO,1

Hey @Moodudu!,0
> Hey is it possible to use ``insert`` with a ``set`` ?@Callisto Casale `.add`,0
`insert` doesn't make sense with a `set` because it's unordered,0
> And how can i specify the position i want to insert a element to?@Callisto Casale `sets` have no order.,0
"therefore there is no idea of position"".",0
> is the closest I can get to an ordered dict by inserting tuples in a list?@VideoCarp `OrderedDict`,0
closest in what way?,0
"```py# 58 Hello Adminusernames = [\'eric\ \'willie\ \'admin\ \'erin\ \'ever\']for username in usernames: if username == \'admin\': print(""Hello admin would you like to see a status report?""else: print(""Hello  + username + thank you for logging in again!"")```What is my mistake here python says I have a syntax error on for else:",1
lol bruhh,0
insert order?,0
python dicts have insert order by default since 3.6,0
but now they want to insert in a specific position right,0
I think you might need to write your own data structure for that,0
`OrderedDict` doesn't support that either,0
does it have to be a tuple?,0
yeah just make it a namedtuple or dataclass at that point,0
> just gonna keep the tuples inside of a list then.@VideoCarp do you need to be able to find a value given a key quickly?,1
if not just use a `list` of `tuples` yeah,0
leetcode?,0
> how do you remove values from a tuple? or is it that you cant?@vinam you can't `tuples` are immutable,0
"```pyusernames = [\'ever\ \'willie\ \'admin\ \'erin\ \'eric\']for username in usernames: if username == \'admin\': print(""Hello admin would you like to see a status report?"")else: print(""Hello  + username +  thank you for logging in again!"")```whats wrong with my code its supposed to print out all the names for the string username but it only prints out eric",1
oh dangit,0
i thought i had it lined up mb,0
when you want to see check if something is in a sequence,0
then sets are good for that,0
plus o(1) adding iirc,0
> Can we ask for general python help here?@e. sure if it'll be quick. if you think it'll take a while use a help channel #❔｜howtogethelp,1
yeah sure,0
idt you can?,0
but you don't need one anyway,0
> how do i get an unordered dict? what good will it do to me?@vinam the nature of hash tables/associative arrays which `dicts` basically are is that they tend to be unordered.,1
so any kind of order is a bonus,0
in recent versions of Python `dicts` are ordered in insertion order,0
(it's part of the spec),0
that said there is no native sorted associative array type in Python,0
there's not really any benefit to making it unordered,0
like insert into sorted order?,0
yes,0
you can make your own using bisect tho,0
I mean you can make your own anything but it won't be a native type,0
what distro @e.,0
debian/ubuntu?,0
`sudo apt install python3`,0
you might need an apt update first,0
pacman CLI opts are too obscure for my tastes,0
Dont use a ide for python,0
Ide bad,0
but that's kinda ot,0
:madbro:,0
ide or editor,0
Editor,0
does python3 version work?,0
you need `sudo apt install python3pip` to install pip,0
@e.,0

the output says if new_users in current_users is wrong am i missing a semicolon,0
yes,0
ok also the line after it is wrong idk how,0
you don't need semicolons in oython,0
you're missing a `+` after `new_user`,0

im rly confused as im trying to learn this its supposed to print out something else,0
it says user is not define im confused,0
ok so you've installed pip but it still says invalid?,0
figured it out i think,0
that's weird,0
@e. pip3,0
Or python3 m pip,0
oh it might be an old distro,0
bruh,0
Use pip3,0
I see,0
Pythonpip is pip for python2,0
pip3 because it's an old ubuntu version,0
I'm too accustomed to debian testing where regular pip is python3,0
Pip is still python2pip in recent distros or some of them,0
I just use python3 m pip anyway,0
Python3pip @e.,0
@e. just do pip3 install pipenv instead,0
Globally,0
```pyif condition: do_something()elif condition2: do_something_else()else: # none of the conditions above are valid do_another_thing()```@Moodudu,0
> how do i install pip globally? just with the same command?@e. if you ran apt install python3pip it's already installed globally,1

Clarify,0
GUI or headless,0
GUI or no GUI,0
> but @Deleted User how do i compare numbers and make it print the greatest lowest or if all are sam cuz first imma tell them to input 3 numbers@Moodudu first you need something that will evaluate to either True or False. For example `1 == 1` is True. `5 > 3` is true,1
3 > 75 is False,0
Now you put that right after if,0
"```pyif 1 > 0: print(""The condition evaluates to True"")```",0
Now for example,0
Use pip3,0
bro,0
Install pip with `apt install python3pip`,0
Then run pip with `pip3 install packagenamewhatever`,0
@e. if your pip path is not set use `python m pip`,0

i need help with a question which should be easy for you guys,0
Accept a string from user and change first letter of every word to capital. In case any other letters are capital  they must change to smallEg a wOLf in jungLE. Must change to A Wolf In Jungle.,1
Just do `\\Scripts\\activate` and see if it works,0
and there are restrictions,0
Are you running python with `python` or `python3` command,0
`python3`i suppose,0
In that case do a `python3 version`,0
Edited,0
Run that,0
i have no idea how to do that,0
im a student and i just started @o0o0keem,0
so .....,0
```apt install python3.7apt install python3.7pip```,0
And run python with `python3.7`,0
no i just joined a new school,0
i was kinda hoping someone could type out the code for me,0
i missed half the year,0
> should i cd out of my directory to install it globally?@e. nah apt installs globally,0
😦,0
Anyone know if python is able to control each apps volume?,0
Depends on your OS and its API,0
Ok,0
@e. `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/getpip.py o getpip.py`,0
Oh I am on windows and I know that u can change your each apps volume but I wanna make it easier for myself,1
Then in the same directory `python3.7 getpip.py`,0
Yeah,0
Paste it in,0
But not sure if is possible,0
No no,0
Execute the first command then run the second command in the same directory,0
Didn't you apt install python3.7?,0
Okay just apt install python3.7minimal as well,0
Now run python3.7 getpip.py,0
Now do python3.7 m pip install pipenv,0
From now on you're gonna have to do it like this. Or you can do `python3.6 m uninstall pipenv` which should remove the other pipenv,1
Okay,0
hello i am a 16 year old currently learning python is it ok if i bring any hard stuff here,0
to learn,0
yes,0
ok,0
thank you,0
> what do i do now should i just run my application?@e. try uninstalling python3.6 pipenv,0

pip uninstall,0
Sorry,0
Python3.6 m pip uninstall pipenv,0
Then python3 m pip uninstall pipenv,0
Np,0
Okay,0
Doesnt matter,0
Now just make a new environment again with pipenv,0
You did `pipenv install` the first time after cloning right?,0
Just do that again should make the new env,0
Iirc. After that do `pipenv run bot` and should work,0
hello,0
am i verified??,0
Try python3.7 m pipenv,0
python3.7 m pipenv install,0
Like that,0
I'll show you how to alias it later. Brb.,0
@e. whenever you use pipenv use it as `python3.7 m pipenv` instead of just `pipenv`,0
`python3.7 m pipenv run bot`,0
Or you can set up an alias,0
Np,0
:+1:,0
Open ~/.bashrc with a text editor,0
@e.,0
Open ~/.bashrc,0
"And add this at the end```shalias pipenv=""python3.7 m pipenv""```",0
Then restart your terminal,0
use a text editor,0
~ is your home directory,0
Mind the squiggle,0
~,0
hello I'm still a beginner please help. Is there a tutorial for beginners here?,0
Do a `nano ~/.bashrc`,0
!resources,0
,0
Then scroll down with the down key and paste this line at the very end,0
Then CTRL+O to save,0
And CTRL + X to exit nano,0
...,0
@e. restart your terminal,0
Now try `pipenv install` without the `python3.7 m` nonsense,0
Did you do it once?,0
The point is that add the alias line at the bottom of the file called .bashrc which is in your home directory,1
You can use your code editor to open that file,0
@e. yes,0
are r strings faster than b,0
or \ \ ?,0
yeah but i use r for bytes and it still works,0

"> `<@ID>`@dennis like await ctx.send(f""<@{ID}>"") ?",0
the one you have there is oldstyle,0
from Python 2,0
yeah that works @Deleted User,0
ok but is there another way?,0
you can just do `user.mention` if you have the user object though,0
hmm,0
because look,0
I could use `<@{ID}>` but if the ID is the argument and it is not an ID how could I check it? (It's not easy 4 me to explain this XD),1
you can use a type annontation,0
which would also convert the ID to a User or Member object,0

well...that's why you don't run code people give you without reading it,0
don't run random scripts off of the internet,0
yep,0
@dennis i was actually thinking about this yesterday. If I have the ID I assume it would be preferable to just use `<@ID>` over creating a user object? While it mayyy make more sense to create an user object it still seems unnecessary to do that,1
I didn't know @✪ SavagePastaMan,0
> ```py> @bot.command()> async def ping(ctx member: discord.Member) > None:> await ctx.send(member.mention)> ```@dennis here the argument should be an ID and then it will converted into ID?,1

ok,0

@Rakiba `\` is a special character. I believe it’s called a “meta character”. It creates a line break,0

"@dennis :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```""Hello""```",0

it's better to use single quotes instead though,0

okay so you can create an infinite while loop to get an input each iteration and append it to a list. make sure you can somehow break out of the loop though.for example:```pywhile True: answer = input(\'Enter quit to exit.\') if answer == \'quit\': break # append input to list```,1

you can create a list out of your string which you can then modify like you were doing. then like @sleepcult says you can put the string back together with `''.join(your_list)`,1

python is great don't get me wrong. but for the tasks that you do in competitive programming python is not the best choice,1
which is pretty rare from what i've seen,0

range only has integers you could do `1 < 1.5 < 3`,0
i think saltdie has his continuous ranges or something,0
sure the simplicity of many of the functions disguises that they are actually looping,0
I've reached that point where I have no motivation to do anything non dpy related :(,0
@vinam @𝓥𝓲𝓷𝓬𝓮𝓷𝓽 that's not the best way to do it no,0
@Xen you are right that you should know the time complexity of the tools and use the best one. Saying Python\'s builtins have messed up time complexities is just misleading.,1
@𝓥𝓲𝓷𝓬𝓮𝓷𝓽 if you want to time how long something takes use `time.perf_counter()` to establish a starting time then measure it again to get a stop time then get the difference between the two times. You don't need to do any loop waiting,1
> @nedbat idk what bytecode is but when python hits an error it will keep reading the code until it finishes cause it reads code line by line@Xen No it doesn't.,1
??????,0
Error = traceback = explosion doesn't it?,0
Logic Error. Sure,0
> yes it does@Xen Maybe I don\'t know what you mean by keep reading the code until it finishes. Can you show us?,1
@Xen Errors will terminate the process unless you catch and handle them.,0
"```pyprint(""hello"")obviously an error```like this?",0
@𝓥𝓲𝓷𝓬𝓮𝓷𝓽 it's just a function you invoke. it returns a time value as a floatingpoint number in seconds,0
@𝓥𝓲𝓷𝓬𝓮𝓷𝓽 you have to run it.`time.perf_counter()`,0
^,0
> i meant the code will still run until it reaches an error while java wont run the code at all if it finds an error@Xen It depends what kind of error.,1
Neither will run anything with a syntax error.,0
Java will find more errors at compile time.,0
> i meant the code will still run until it reaches an error while java wont run the code at all if it finds an error@Xen wait you mean that it will continue to execute until it reaches said error right?,1

> Python itself isn\'t a language it\'s just a simple way to write C code.@atlas_core how many different misleading things can we say?,1
that's like sayng C is a simple way to write assembly,0

no I don't know what I'm saying.,0
the fuck does python have anything to do with being simpler version of c,0

none of this happened.,0

Python.,0
@Lucid°^° I wrote the software that powers my blog in Python and I have a personal wiki/org suite w/a web frontend as well,1
Is it possible to download packages with code?,0
@Sire Moyale an installer?,0

"```python{ users"":{ User1"":""Normal"", User2"":""Mod"", User3"":""Admin"" }}```How could I print User1 User2 and User3 separatly and some seconds after the same thing but with their roles (Normal Mod and Admin)",1
you should be pretty good in one lang before moving on to others,0
@Sire Moyale Jython uses the JVM as its runtime which can in theory support any language,0
jython is python on the jvm,0
everything is pretty much the same control flow conditionals etc. only thing different is the syntax pretty much,0
@BootyBoy best to ask in #databases but there are a fair number of database primers around the web to read up on too,1

aython?,0
cython does exist,0
whats aython,0
yes Cython is a thing,0

it's a way to have C code inline with python,0

> drastic structural changes@Lucid°^° What changes do you mean?,0
That's not a change Python never had braces,0
> @nedbat a lot of changes with every new update@Lucid°^° New features yes like all languages. They don't break your code though.,1
indentation isn't required in other langs but if you don't have it you'll hate yourself forever,0
> @Lucid°^° most libraries arent compatible with 3.9@KortaPo Most libraries are compatible but they aren't marked as such on PyPI,0
@KortaPo that has less to do with the language itself and more to do with the libraries in question having binary components that need to be built for a specific version,1
not really?,0
uh,0
@KortaPo those aren't syntax changes,0
Guys is GIT good for beginners for programming?,0
@Deleted User it's a pretty vital skill to have these days,0
@Deleted User it does have a learning curve associated with it so it's probably a good idea to set aside some time to learn it by itself,1
@JagTheFriend it's software that manages changes in a codebase.,0
not really it's a version control system helps to keep track of what changes you're doing,0
python is about the same age as java,0

well what are the basics then. if statements? looping?,0

@Deleted User GUI? PYTHON?!,0

pysimplegui import?,0
😹😹😹😹😹,0
Python = bad gui,0

why can't you learn basics in python? does python not have if statements or loops?,0

so?,0
then learn jAvA,0

.randomcase Hi,0
jYtHoN,0
@Aboo Minister nothing is missing. You can build real things with Python.,0
yes it does,0
@Lucid°^° not true.,0
it helps with logic,0
you still learn programming basics like control flow and oop,0
uh they know it's an int because `10` is an int,0
`x: int = 10`,0
syntax is slightly different but so is every other language,0
@KortaPo did you overlook that you can typeannotate in Python?,0
well,0
@KortaPo Seriously are you just here to talk people out of using Python?,0
c++ has some nonbeginner friendly features like RAII and memory managment,0
and custom opeartors,0
and copy constructors,0
memory management is probably the biggest one,0
and move constructors,0
is learning machine learning good for beginners in python?,0
and fuckign templates,0
@Deleted User machine learning isn't really a beginner's task no matter what language you use,0
machine learning is definitely not a beginner topic,0
@Sire Moyale no it doesnt,0
ah sorry lmao,0
vars dont have types,0
because `10` is an int,0
variables dont have types,0
yes the value has a type,0
but not the variable itself,0
@KortaPo what else would `10` be?,0
no `10` cannot be a string it is always an int,0
"`""10""` is a string",0
10,0
i never said types don't existi just said that variables dont have fixed typesbut values do have types,0
I think we should leave !1 to their misconceptions.,0
"like you can do `x=10; x=""asdf""` and that works",0

@KortaPo this being a Python server you will almost certainly get a yes and that\'s because it is indeed a great first language,1
not at the same ttime,0
@Chili basic python isnt good enough. You need to know OOP,0
because of the GIL,0
> when I use multithreading all the threads get utilized?@pratt It depends what they are doing.,0
@pratt if you're talking about using all available hardware threads then you'd need to use `multiprocessing`,0
i mean that exists in python also,0
> java is so fun bc of the classes and constructors@Winter you don't write classes in Python?,0
java is way too verbose tho,0
> Java classes,0
when you put strings together,0
🤢,0
gEtTeRs aNd sEtTeRs fOr eNcaPsuLaTIoN,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan my api is better than pythons,0
I mean discord's,0
because that is definitely what getters and setters are for,0
instead of just making public variables,0
"!e```pystring1 = hello""string2 = world""# concatenationstring3 = string1 + string2print(string3)```",0
@✪ SavagePastaMan :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```helloworld```,0
the boilerplate gets old fast,0
@hmmm properties are a thing,0
> in python due to GIL only one thread runs at a time but using multiprocessing one thread per core could run at a time right?@pratt it depends what they are doing.,1
it'd be hard to use python for everything but you could probably do it yeah,0
@pratt you can launch multiple instances of the Python interpreter each of which will use their own hardware thread. But you would still have to coordinate activity between them which is potentially its own bottleneck,1
yeah ik properties are a thing,0
but java doesnt have that,0
> @nedbat what does that mean? `What they are doing?` I mean they are running processing something  what else is there?@pratt If they are doing I/O it can be concurrent. If they are computing in a wellwritten library like numpy they can be concurrent.,1
But python does so don't use getters and setters in python,0
and then people try to justify using getters and setters in java by saying wHaT iF yOu wAnT tO aDd cHeCks aka what properties are for,1
java bad,0
oop good,0
no way to answer that but oop is very ingrained into java ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯,0
> if not for GIL multithreading would be equal to multiprocessing if I launch all 10 threads on all my 10 cores at the same time?@pratt You might need some of your own locking too but basically yes.,1
js has oop tho,0
not classical oop but it does have oop,0

It's just the name of a parameter,0
that happens to refer to a class,0
i've been having an error for so long now... and i was stumped and confused,0
`self` and `cls` are just names that are used by convention not keywords,0
Saw something that made me go like 🤨 Checked it...,0
"```py>>> bool(""False"")True```and this was why \'\",0
`cls` is just convention for a variable thats a class,0
whats the best way to deal with xls data using flask? I have a mysql db. I'd need to do things like export reports or use xls files as a way to upload data,1

guys is it correct?,0
@pratt Yes. As well as self.,0
that is indeed unreachable code at the bottom,0
^,0
> why just not use `while True` if you are creating an infinite loop@vinam okay i'll do that,0
it became Italics?,0
@pratt Yes. Those are very common conventions and there's pretty much no reason to break them so they are often highlighted.,1
Yea i know what you meant...,0
but I was confused cause i've never had vscode turned anything i've typed into italics,0

@BalmierLight Yep but first: don't use `dict` as variable name since it will shadow builtin `dict`,0
sure it was an example,0
and you could just take an input and get value from dict by it @BalmierLight,0
> and you could just take an input and get value from dict by it @BalmierLight@Doctor likedict[value here]?,0
@BalmierLight You could do something like this```pydict_ = {'abc': 42}input_ = input()print(dict_[input_])```,0
uhm so If I inputted 42 I get abc? @Doctor,0
dict[key] returns value,0
no viceversa,0
if you input abc you'll get 42,0
abc is a key and 42 is a value,0
> if you input abc you'll get 42@Doctor I want the opposite I want to give the value so it returns the key,1
> @Isaiah The Greatest well why can’t you and the bot be in the same server?@albertisbetterthanflamingo ????????If you have your dms from nonfriends set as off... then only your friends can message you...can't add bots as a friend... so it will raise discord.Forbidden,1

and guess which one they want to do,0
@BalmierLight And why can't you store members as keys?,0
> @BalmierLight And why can't you store members as keys?@Doctor members ARE stored as Keys,0
i meant channels,0

Hey I want suggestion from people I have a website to scrape that some parts are not in the HTML code unless you click on a javascript button which adds that to part of the code. I wonder how may I capture that part WITHOUT using selenium because it is too heavy and slow and... I appreciate any help,1
@Deleted User You'll have to use a tool similar to selenium e.g. <https://pypi.org/project/requestshtml/>. You still have to emulate the DOM and run a JavaScript engine which is why it's not very fast. Although I would imagine that a website that dynamically generates data and doesn't expose its API endpoints doesn't appreciate scraping and may even disallow it in its ToS.,1
@SavageMorse If this is not related to Python see offtopic channels.,0
!warn @tragic Don't post resources that violate laws or ToS here.,0

you should use #help channels for question though,0
@SisasCamel Doing it exactly as you said  i.e. running the script from where it stopped  might not be a great idea. If you change the script what should it do? What should it do if you've stopped the file in the middle of a network request? And how would you inspect that state?While this is technically possible (and Smalltalk for example can save the state of a program to a file) for a programming language Python can't do that. The best way would be to define what the state of your program really is (i.e. a list of users) and save it on disk. For example you can use the `json` module to encode a JSON document.,1
> yes and i'm saying if you can't reverse engineer the page so that you can get past the button click via curl you're out of luck@snax Then I think I have to learn js in order to make it optimised... Here we go again...,1

@Secret I would recommend you to put that code in while loop,0
@Secret please ask that question in help channel you'll get person attention towards your code and people will try to help you instead of diverting form the topic,1
@snax Pickle is not used for persistence. It's not secure it's not versionable and it's not humanreadable,0
Well if it's small and local then yes. Although if it's a list of primitives it will be as easy with `json` as it is with `pickle` with the benefit of readability.,1
You probably don't need a database for your project. You can get away with just saving a JSON file.,0
Are you familiar with JSON?,0
"@SisasCamel JSON is JavaScript Object Notation"". A JSON _document_ is either:1. Integer (like 42)2. Float (like 3.14)3. String (like `""string""`)4. List of JSON documents (like `[1 2 3]`)5. Dictionary with stringly keys (like `{""hello"": 1 world"": 2 aaa"": [3 four [""a""]]}`).",1
You can use the `json` module to save and load JSON documents.,0
(and `null`),0
json doesn't have a character type,0
it's based on JS which like python doesn't have a character type,0
```pytry: ...except: ...```is a bare except you need something after the `except`,0
to specify the exception,0
except ImportError:,0
for example,0
@Derick Gamer 7.7.7.7.7.7.7.7.7.7 JS does not have a character type neither does JSON.,0
umm how do we create python functions in c++ and then import them in a python script,0
and neither does Python,0
@Leonard It's not an actual error. It's a warning that your editor shows to you. Most of the time it's not a good idea but it's valid Python.,1
i wonder how do we do that,0
"```pytry: 1/0except ValueError: print(""div by zero"")``` @Leonard",0
ah,0
i see,0
no,0
`chr` returns the ascii representation given its ascii code,0
it returns a string,0
@Derick Gamer 7.7.7.7.7.7.7.7.7.7 `chr` is a function that takes an integer and returns a _string_.,0

@fix error :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```001 | 002 | <class str'>```,0
or unicode rather not ascii,0
Both JS and Python do not have a `char` type,0
no that's not correct,0
i'm not sure what to tell you fix posted an example above,0
`chr` returns a `str`,0
@Derick Gamer 7.7.7.7.7.7.7.7.7.7 That's not true. A `str` is not a list and when you index into it or iterate over it you get other `str`s.,1
"!e```pystring = abc""for char in string: print(repr(char) type(char))```",0
@fix error :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```001 | a <class str'>002 | b <class str'>003 | c <class str'>```,1
it's the most common way to do it tho,0
very few languages actually expose strings as raw arrays/lists of char,0
the 2 i can think of are C and haskell,0
and the haskell community agrees that this was a mistake,0

"@fix error Literal ConstantsAn example of a literal constant is a number like 5 1.23 or a string like \'This is a string\ or It\'s a string!"".It is called a literal because it is literal  you use its value literally. The number 2 always represents itself and nothing else  it is a constant because its value cannot be changed. Hence all these are referred to as literal constants.",1
@AstroBoy9000 A literal is a value that is constructed exactly as you wrote it in code. For example you write `42` and the value it represents is well the number 42. In other words a literal is a way of specifying a piece of data (value of a number or contents of a string) in code.,1

turn it off and on,0
Ok,0

Oh ok,0
complex numbers aren't real,0
floats are real numbers that aren't ints i think,0
?? i was thinking int means numbers so what do u mean Real Numbers?,0
oh with 0.432?,0
is a float,0
cuz i remember that int will round the 0.32 but it seems like 20.5 or something it doesnt round,0
some numbers are imaginary some are real some are… well… complex,0

what would you call a variable that stores a callable? @kendalk08,0
> I have a script that I\'m parsing args in via function def main(argv) and I\'m consciously setting global variables for the values but I\'m pretty sure there\'s a much better way. Is that better way to return the values or some other pattern?@5280A are you using `argparse`? if not you probably should.,1
> @gm variables doesnt store a callable. it stores the value of that callable.@kendalk08 no like this:```pyfrom functools import partialdef add_two_numbers(a: int b: int) > int: return a + bpartial(f b=1) # if you wanted to assign this to a variable what would you call it?```,1
what do you mean by value of that callable incidentally,0
@5280A `getopt` is deprecated use `argparse`,0
yes that's my point. `x = func` is valid too.,0
also that is not properly called the value of the callable IMO but rather its return value (given a set of arguments),1
no what I mean is,0
you're basically saying camel case for functions and snake case for variables right?,0
but variables can store functions (or more generally callables too).,0
and there are situations where you should.,0
so does that mean that your variable name style should differ based on what it contains?,0
(and for that matter there is no real distinction between a name bound to a function and one bound to something else; `def` is just syntactic sugar),1
yup so going back to my question: say you have a function that returns a function. what style would you use for a variable that stores the result of that?,1
but then you've stored a callable in a snake case variable,0
"Classes are named with PascalCase even when generated dynamically.```pyfrom collections import namedtuplePoint = namedtuple(""Point [""x y""])```",0
which breaks your original convention.,0

> @gm no it doesnt. just because a variable is callable doesnt mean its not just a variable waiting for its value...@kendalk08 well I mean if it works out for you that's great,1
> its easy to write a variable that is also a function. but cant be done with my styleIf you had a typechecker (why not have it?) it's easy to catch.,1
> If you had a typechecker (why not have it?) it's easy to catch.@fix error and like I said...this breaks down when you have variables that store functions.,1
I don't follow all of PEP8 but the naming conventions seem pretty reasonable,0
because functions are firstclass in Python,0
`s/typechecker/typechecker or tests`,0
And making two values `some_thing` and `someThing` that are completely unrelated (otherwise you wouldn't have made the mistake in the first place) seems pretty confusing to me.And if a class is so big that it's hard to keep track of its properties and methods that code is probably hard to navigate.,1

@kendalk08 Sorry I missed the original question somehow :DIf you want to make a singleton I would just use a module but that's up to you (both approaches are used).I'm not sure what's even the purpose of the `ChatObjects` class  maybe a more complex example could explain better,1
wdym by that,0
like i hit run more than once? if so than yeahl,0
can i invite you to the server to show you?,0
ok,0
@AADevelops its supposed to send it Once. not 3 times.,0
and its sending the wrong ones,0
@Akatsuki_ Your problem is that you need brackets in your conditions,0
@Akatsuki_ `x == 1 and y == 2 or y == 3` < This will evaluate to true if y is 3 even if x is not 1.,1
... when i do the command $car then the bot sends it... but i only want it to send once,0
@AADevelops plus I didn’t ss the bot sending the messages,0
@Akatsuki_ To get the effect you're after you would need to write it `x == 1 and (y == 2 or y == 3)`,1
I’ll send another one,0
@Morning `'_ in your_string`,0
@Akatsuki_ Though in your case it would be much more compact to write `x == 1 and y in [2 3]`,1
That's how you would check if underscore in a string,0
Also to check if string contains at least one digit you should write something like`any(c.isdigit() for c in string)`,0
Ok,0
@Fivedog80 1. It depends 2. You should ask in offtopic,0
@Pater Can you stop please? If you want to discuss something other than Python go to offtopic channels,0
@Morning That wouldn't really work,0
What are criteria for your password?,0
"@kendalk08 I see. Yes that makes sense. Since a root element and the child elements are closely related I would put them in the same object like `ChatWindow` and then store the `ChatWindow`s in the `gui` object. Something like:```pyroot_element = LabelFrame(window text=\'Today @ 3:45AM\ padding=""5 0 5 height=150)root_element.pack(expand=\'no\ fill=\'both\ side=\'top\')gui.addElement( ChatWindow(root_element [ (Label(root_element text=\'Kendal Knabe\ font=(""Helvetica 14)) (0 5)), (Label(root_element text=\'Quote/Mention\') (145 11)), (Label(root_element text=\'This is a message\ font=(""Helvetica 10)) (0 25)) ]))```",1
P.S. Sorry if I was to aggressive in the style discussion it's not that big of a deal 🙂,0
@Morning You can use the function any() with a generator expression to do this pythonically.,0
@Morning so allowed characters are `az` `09` and `_`?,0
@Morning Like `any(c.isdigit() for c in password)`,0

@dementati what will be a good way to apply filter function to list of tuples? (For example `dict.items()`?Problem is you can't unpack arguments in lambda functions,1
@kendalk08 Also another small change: you can use tuples as dictionary keys so you can store the elements with `(c_id pos)` or `(c_id name)` as keys instead of strings.,1
> @dementati what will be a good way to apply filter function to list of tuples? (For example `dict.items()`?> Problem is you can't unpack arguments in lambda functions@Doctor Can you show us the details?,1
@nedbat ```pydict_ = {}filtered_items = filter(lambda kv: kv dict.items())```We can't unpack tuples in lambdas anymore i believe so something like `lambda (k v):` won't work.It's just not very convenient to use indices,1
Perhaps it's better to use list comprehension?,0

"!e```pyclass AssociativeArray: def __init__(self): self.pairs = [] def __getitem__(self requested_key): for (key value) in self.pairs: if key == requested_key: return value raise KeyError(key) def __setitem__(self new_key new_value): for (i (key _value)) in enumerate(self.pairs): if key == new_key: self.pairs[i] = (new_key new_value) return self.pairs.append((new_key new_value))assoc = AssociativeArray()assoc[1] = hello""assoc[""aaa""] = [1 2 3]assoc[[1 2]] = 0assoc[1] = world""print(assoc[1])print(assoc.pairs)```",1

nvm figured it out i think,0
@lunar if ur a python begineer i suggested python crash course is an amazing book,0
@Doctor Use a comprehension expression,0
Yep i think that's the best way,0
"@Doctor `k v for k v in some_dict.items() if v == foo""`",0
"print (""guessing game"")print (""chose 4 or 5"")input(""enter a number: )number2 = 4number2 = input()Trueprint (""Well done"")number1 = 5number1 = input()False print (""Unlucky Try again next time"") when i put 4 in the console it doesnt respond with an answer??",1
filter() is rarely useful since comprehensions cover most use cases,0
@Deleted User 1. Format your code,0
!code,0

2. You aren't taking any input from console,0
I told it to you already @Deleted User,0
@kendalk08 You can override pretty much anything you want. If you ever want to do that: <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html>,0
@Deleted User Oh you're but you have some redundant calls to input() function,0
@Deleted User What are you trying to do in a first place?,0

@BoogtehWoog Just pick the middle value from sequence shouldn't be hard. People here can help you if you want,0

hi,0
i have a bunch of numbers like this 1234,0
how do i add all of them together?,0
@Deleted User You have a list of numbers right?,0
@Deleted User like `numbers = [1 2 3 42]`,0
ok so i have my code right now like i = 1while i < 101: print(i) i = i + 1im trying to add 1 2 3 4 5 to 100 using a while loop. Ive gotten to print the numbers 1 to 100 but i need them to add together somehow,1
@Deleted User `print(sum(range(1 100 + 1)))`,0
That would be a best way to do that,0
@Deleted User really,0
> @Deleted User `print(sum(range(1 100 + 1)))`@Doctor is it possible to do this with a while loop?,0
Sure but you could use for loop,0
```pynumbers_sum = 0for number in range(1 100+1): numbers_sum += numberprint(numbers_sum)```@Deleted User,0
i can already do it with for loop. Homework asks me to do it with while loop,0
Well for loop is basically a while loop,0
ohhh i see,0
```pynumbers_sum = 0i = 1while i <= 100: numbers_sum += i i += 1print(numbers_sum)```,0
hi guys!!,0
im new,0
what does a += mean?,0
it adds value to an object,0
im just begging python i think its really fum,0
not quite the same as i = i + 1 but for integers it's basically the same,0
@Deleted User it is,0

@Potatoi That's just a bad way to reverse a list,0
But for learning purposes it's fine,0
a lot of compsci courses emphasize recursion. it's an old habit.,0
@Potatoi it seems like you haven't written the code yet.,0
@Potatoi are you supposed to reverse list in place or return reversed one?,0
@Potatoi Also yeah try to solve it yourself first then come for help if you can't figure out some moments,0
@Potatoi Also template that teacher gave you is incorrect,0
last two lines should be ```pyif __name__ == __main__': main()```,0

@nedbat Yeah maybe,0
Since he didn't use codeblock,0
when i install the newest python version instead of it asking to upgrade it says install now,0

@gm :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```<class set'>```,0
the empty curly brackets is a dict,0
> @gm then y did u say this?? i am confused now@_aditya braces are used for both `dict` and `set`; the difference is that `dicts` have keys and values for example:```pyd = {'key1': value1 key2': value2'} # dicts = {'element1 element2'} # set```however there is one special case: the empty `set` which is defined with `set()` instead of `{}` (which is the empty `dict`),1
> @gm if u do this> A = {}> Print(type(A))> Output would be dict@Lucid°^° the specific case I replied to is a `set` not a `dict`.,1
{} creates empty dict if you list elements in {} as you do in lists for example {1 2 3} then it will create a set,1
@_aditya `{}` was picked as an empty dict deliberately because dict literals occur way more often than set literals.,0

@TestyExorcist ok  instead of `virtualenv` alone try `py m virtualenv`,0
@Ansh if you mean `else: if` then yes it's basically the same thing only more idiomatic.,0

@TestyExorcist right you have to supply the rest of the command yourself.,0
you originally said `virtualenv env` (with `env` being the destination). so now you say `py m virtualenv env`,0

python concurrency,0
i heard python has not great multithread support you could try java or c++,0
also im not sure if multiprocessing is actually slower or not,0
compared to multithread,0
because spawning each process is gonna gib massive overhead in java,0
idk if thats the case for python as well,0
to add results to the same thing needs to be a blocked op,0
else you create race conditions,0
you spawn threads,0
and each logical processor could run only one thread at the same time iirc,0
more threads than your logical processor count would actually make them share the critical section,0
so theres concurrency and parallelism,0
concurrency is multiple threads share critical section which means they execute in turn,0
parallelism is just each thread has their own resources completely indepent,0
what you want should be a mixed of these two ithink,0
while those 10 cpus do parallelized computations then another cpu or thread to add those results,0
you could set the thread thats adding these up to a daemon that monitors all those 10 cpus,0
or you could build a queue,0
push the results from those 10 cpus into the queue which will be visible to the thread responsible to adding the results together,1
that thread will then take tasks from the queue then process those,0
there should be some kind of frameworks to handle thread control for you,0
Anyone know which course to take for beginners in python. I want to learn AI and ML after i learn basics of python,1
manual thread control is kinda hard lol,0
also theres also lightweight concurrency,0
where if each task is so lightweight(completes in a short time),0
it would actually be a good thing to spawn threads on the fly,0
but this creates another problem where if you spawn too many threads,0
you lose performance lol,0
these are only scratching the surface of what you need to consider on multithreading,0
i dont know any more advanced stuff you should probbly look those up,0
we do have some python gods here i think could help with this but they are nowhere to be found rn lol,1
python multiprocessing and threading module tutorials are wrong sometimes,0
i googled a bunch a lot of them doesnt even run,0
Oh,0
they also dont really explain a good amount on thread control and the logic behind it,0
ok,0
lol id recommend you google multithread stuff in compiled language tutorials,0

sure .,0
but how do i get the next item from the list?,0
"```pythondef lower(string=""Example""): print(string.islower())```",0
@Vestergurkan,0
Output is False,0
bc islower,0
The output should be xample,0
Without the E because E is uppercase,0
you should write lower,0
islower returns bool while lower a string,0
> you should write lower@Amuri That would print all the lowercase letters.,0
Ah. You’re using the function `islower`. This checks if the entire string is lowercase and returns true or false,0
yes,0
i dont need to  its my coding homework,0
if a string is Hello the output should be ello,0
It sounds to me like you’re trying to remove the capital letters and not make them lowercase as you originally said,1
yes thats right,0
thats what im trying to say @Vestergurkan,0
Do you have any ideas of how you’d like to solve this?,0
guys ik how,0
nope but it should not use any lambda or list comp,0
only english,0
Hmm very odd that you can’t use list comps. You could do the same things as you would with a list como but with a loop,1
```pythonres = [char for char in test_str if char.islower()] ```,0
this worked fine but without the list comp.,0

i know arduino,0
@gaetgu interesting. I didnt leaarn python until python2 was already trying to be sunet so i never touched it,0
what?,0
why not python,0
You open the docs and reaad them.,0
read their documentation and build stuff with it,0
why would you want to enforce typechecking just use a statically typed lang then,0
type hinting is usually enough. You can also run a type checker called mypy if you really want to.,0
well OOP isn't ingrained into your code like it is in java if that's what you mean,0

whats django i feel like ive heard bout it,0
@iodbh there is only one tech lead,0
Static generated pages are pretty hip as well for like developer pages.. I use pelican which is a python port of Jekyll,1
the docs are quite overwhelming for a beginner programmer and that's quite rude @ooze,0
oh if you can't pick something up on the first try programming isn't for you,0
> if you can't handle reading docs programming isnt for you@ooze reading docs to learn a new package is often like reading a dictionary to learn English.,1
really dude?,0
sure some packages have really nice tutorials/quickstarts,0
I think its a really bad take that If you cant follow reference material when you\'re new programming isnt for you,1
but some are literally just pretty docstrings.,0
that's just not true @ooze why can't they get support from a nice community if it exists,0
Man learning to read documentation can be super hard. Especially when you're learning a language and see all sorts of crazy things like args kwargs and so on,1
but you have to try first reading the docs ant then ask,0
> it\'s not something for first try  if you need to ask random communities to get other people to tell you shit instead of getting the information yourself you will never get far in programming. it\'s just the truth@ooze there is some amount of truth to this but there is no reasson to be elitist about it,1
or to gatekeep,0
but uh how are they gonna read more if they just quit like you said,0
I agree with ooze somewhat but I think the attitude is shitty. lol. I would put the same concept with less condescension and elitism.,1
how should I add authentication to my app,0
I think its more of Do you start with asking randoms or do you end up there after you try,0
the latter is perfectly fine,0
I agree with the principle but honestly you\'ll never be a good programmer if you can\'t read docs to a beginner is pretty wild IMO,1
yeah,0
what is `__init__` from a theoretical perspective is an excellent question IMO,0
Sol at the stage where people are asking questions like that they are not just new. They are new to being new.,1
They will learn possibly to figure things out themselves sometimes,0
> Who can I ask stuff about networking specifically the requests module?@electricarcs you can ask anyone but depending on what you want it for you might want to try #datascienceandai or #webdevelopment,1
@gm it's same as the constructor in java.,0
> @gm it's same as the constructor in java.@Deleted User it actually isn't that simple,0
@gm then what is it ?,0
> @gm Yeah obviously I can ask anyone lol my question implied that I was looking for someone with experience in those fields but thanks@electricarcs wups I meant anywhere actually,1
> @gm then what is it ?@Deleted User it has no direct analogue in many languages because the responsibility of constructing a new instance is split between `__new__` and `__init__`,1
> Ooh@electricarcs anyway just post your question,0
That question might be suited to #careerdiscussion,0
@gm so what's the purpose of __init__ in python?,0
@4colors if you want to know what what type is use type(something),0
its the method that is run when a class is instantiated into an object @Deleted User,0
> @Deleted User it\'s a constructor if u don\'t know what that is its a function that\'s called any time u make an object from the class@STG996 that\'s what I was trying to avoid...it\'s not a constructor. I\'d say the most appropriate term is initialiser,1
it sets instance attributes.,0
dang `__init__` is an initializer,0
because in most languages constructor does what `__new__` and `__init__` do together,0
it's p cool what Python does but it is confusing,0
I was so bad at understanding Python docs when I first started that when I finally got good enough to learn Django I didnt realize the docs were the first place I should start.,1
> @gm is it not? I felt it was the exact same thing when I started c++...@STG996 not really. you can do some wild things with Python that you can't really in C++.,1
@ooze you might be aa good programamer but you'd make a horrible educator lol,0
> fair enough@STG996 but this is all very esoteric and maybe I'm a bit too twitchy about this,0
lol,0
if you gloss over things I guess it's fine to call `__init__` the constructor since most people rarely have a use for `__new__`,1
with init you can acess on a other method the variables you stated in __init__,0
> @gm I honestly just got introduced to this so idk too much about this lol@STG996 basically in Python you can do kinda weird stuff like this:,1
uh oh,0
Dude I didnt learn to read Python docs for a long time.,0
Some docs for certain libs are so confusing I literally grep github for usages of methods to figure out how to use them,1
It took me time to learn how to odo that,0
!e```pyclass X: def __new__(cls kwargs): return 0x = X()print(type(x))```,0
@gm :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```<class int'>```,0
yeah but when people are askinmg What is an integer you dont link them to reference manual. You link them to instructionaal material.,1
@STG996 so yeah you can see like even though you would expect an object of type `X` because I overrode `__new__` I got an object of another type (`int`) entirely,1
> What does __new__ do anyway?@Sire Moyale see above,0
basically return an uninitialised instance of a class but not necessarily the one you called.,0
> @gm wow ok that's weird@STG996 yeah. and if I were to define `__init__` on that it wouldn't even be called because of what `__new__` did,1
,0
sure but the point was that you said that you shouldn't learn if you aren't familiar with the docs,0
especially when you're learning,0
then im supposed to write in every class i have the __iniT__,0

Image processing is considered inputoutput bound IO? I'm deciding if to use ThreadPool or ProcessPool in async,0

I don't think so..?,0
what if the chnnel for help? (python),0
so if i did reduce(seconds_until_i_die),0
@vinam first at index 0 and 1 then it will pass to function result of it and argument at index 2... etc,1
> what if the chnnel for help? (python)#❔｜howtogethelp,0
Not unless you did seconds = reduce(seconds),0
@vinam for example if we have list [2 3 4 5] and function sumIt will pass to sum 2 and 3 then 6 and 4 etc..,1
If iterable ends it will return the result,0
hm,0
hold on,0
yeah but keep in mind  in case of substraction it will sub other elements of the list from element with index 0,1
That's exactly what you need i think,0
```pyimport operatorfrom functools import reducelist_ = [100 10 10 10]print(reduce(operator.sub list_))>> 70```,0
how do I make it so per se a loop would automatically reduce/increase a variable by a custom amount (lets say two) every say 3 seconds?,1
@Deleted User It depends on what your program must do with that variable,0
say it was a seconds variable for a countdown,0
could i reduce/increase it by 1 every 1 second,0
So no other code will run in a same time?,0
well,0
i would have it do ```print(seconds)``` on loop,0
every second but idk how to time a loop either im really new to python sorry,0
"@Emily. f.read(""text.txt"")",0
@Deleted User ```pyimport timecountdown = 5 # time in secondsfor i in range(countdown 1  1 1): print(i) time.sleep(1)print(0)``` I think that would do,1

@Deleted User You'll need that since it's one of the most used constructions in python,0
like [23 234 34] => 2323434,0
thanks i will learn some more then come back if i have question,0
you guys are all so helpful,0
i tried searching it up but i couldnt find them,0
oh ok,0
i see,0
@SushiMan You got a list of nonstring objects?,0
no but like how do you concat them,0
With enums  is there a way to allow the enum to be written just as is?```pythonclass Color(Enum): BLUE = blue'print(Color.BLUE)```I want the print to say `blue` without having to do `Color.BLUE.value`,1
OH,0
ok thats i forgot about that,0
...,0
@SushiMan```pylist_ = [1 2 3 4]print(''.join(str(i) for i in list_))```,0
thank you so much,0
Yep that's the problem,0

@boopy `args` is usually what it's called. It basically let's you enter however many arguments you need. I'll share a few guides,1

what is a stack overflow errror i got it in a loop script,0
?#,0
^ I think this has a quite good explanation. If you wanna learn more about them I'd also recommend this article or args and kwargs: https://realpython.com/pythonkwargsandargs/,1
its not,0
trust,0
pls its acc not,0
what is an elif statement?,0
oh,0
its basiaclly the thing that comes after if,0
can someone explain what stack overflow is,0
i got an error for it,0
It's basically just a neat thing that python has to prevent you from having to do this:```pyif condition: do_something()else: if something: do_something_else()```Instead you can combine it into one thing:```pyif condition: do_something()elif something: do_something_else()```,1
but its an rttot,0
ok thanks,0
@Vestergurkan can you help me with stack overflow,0
ok,0
@Vestergurkan Yes imagine multiple elseif statements without elif in python,0
Does python work better with jpeg or png?,0
in clike languages it's ok since you don't have to indent so you can write else if on one line,0
@Winter sorry my internet isnt working,0
they could've implemented it like writing `else if` instead but I think `elif` is quite neat once you get used to it,1
hi,0
@vinam arguments after  are keyword only,0
oh w8,0
That's not it,0
@vinam Nvm it is. Arguments after `` are keyword only,0
@hippyclipper Why so?,0
so you have to explicitly pass it as `some_name=Something`,0
@vinam It `packs` into itself all the keyword arguments that aren't listed in function,0
i believe,0
"kwargs = key word argumentsThat\'s how I used to remember it. It lets you specify arguments with keywords like this:```pydef foo(kwargs): print(kwargs[""bar""])foo(bar=""hey!"")```",1
I'd recommend this article or args and kwargs: https://realpython.com/pythonkwargsandargs/This helped me get the hang of it,0
@vinam```pydef f(a  b kwargs): print(a b kwargs)# f(1) b is required# f(1 2) Unexpected argument 2f(1 b='b') # 1 b {}f(1 b='b zzz=1) # 1 b {'zzz': 1}```,1
@Vestergurkan can u help me pls,0
If someone can help they will,0
what does += mean/do,0
@Deleted User I'll show you an example,0
@Sire Moyale,0
you need to put it in a class,0
ok thanks,0
you have the var self but not in a class,0
rude.,0
??,0
```pyx += 2x = x + 2```These two are identical. The first one is simply a shorthand for saying increment by 2,1
> @OmarUsman I did that's why the `self` is there@Sire Moyale show me how you run it,0
actually thats wrong,0
ok,0
thanks,0
@Vestergurkan Despite they look identical they do different things for mutable and immutable objects right?,0
Because if object is immutable it will create new one otherwise it will mutate it,0
Hmm? Could you give an example of this?,0
ints and lists are good example,0
its complicated @glitterworld vagabond,0
Ah I see. I did some more research in it. Thanks for telling me,0
@Vestergurkan ```pya = 1_000_000print(id(a))a += 42print(id(a))```,0
Different objects,0
This explains it <https://stackoverflow.com/a/2347423/11661386>,0
@Vestergurkan In C since everything is mutable it mutates original,0
@Sire Moyale add () after the class name like this```pythonclass funcclass(): ...```,0
Right right. Looks like `+=` tries to use an inplace add first while it simply uses add for immutable types. Interesting,1
@Vestergurkan ```pylist_ = [1 2 3]print(id(list_))new_list = list_ + [4]print(list_ is new_list) # False# list_ += [4] will mutate original```Notice that with immutable objects `obj += othr_obj` and `obj = obj + oth_obj `is identical / almost identical,1
same error?,0
i think its because str is a python variable and its getting confused,0
change it to something like str_,0
and try again,0
Very interesting indeed. Now I know,0
@Vestergurkan If you define that method in your class you could actually control if it will create a new object or return self,1
"print(""Nice!"")",0
Nice!,0
I WORKED OMG,0
Yepppp,0
"> @OmarUsman Still receiving error@Sire Moyale try passing them like this```pythonfuncclass.func(target=""C:/dest/to/path str_=""Hello"")```",0
@Vestergurkan I think it will look like this```pyfrom __future__ import annotationsclass Immutable: def __init__(self value: int): self.value = value def __radd__(self other: Immutable): return Immutable(self.value + other.value)class Mutable: def __init__(self value: int): self.value = value def __radd__(self other: Mutable): self.value += other.value return self```,1
@Sire Moyale where do you instantiate the class?,0
like how are you using the class,0
by just funcclass.func,0
or```pythonfunc = funcclass()func.func(...)```,0
Is that changing the actual mutable and immutable classes...?,0
@Vestergurkan Immutable will create new one Mutable will mutate,0
I mean will those methods then be used on the actual objects like strings and lists?,0
I believe yes,0
But they're implemented in c probably,0
@Vestergurkan it actually should be `iadd` though,0
Yeah,0
try just putting in the class and calling the function form it,0
```pyimmut = Immutable(42)print(id(immut))immut += Immutable(1)print(id(immut)) # Id changedmut = Mutable(42)print(id(mut))mut += Mutable(1)print(id(mut)) # Id didn't change```,0
from,0
import the class not the functions,0
then instantiate it,0
then use it to call the function form,0
from,0
@OmarUsman That isn't a good solution,0
If they're just a plain function and don't use class state,0
show all the code or most of it @Sire Moyale,0
brb,0
@vinam Idk but python is opensource 🙂,0
@Sire Moyale Do you really need class for that? It's useless,0
@vinam it uses a fairly common and wellregarded algorithm the Mersenne Twister for PRNG,0
@vinam for cryptographically secure RNG it uses the OS's services for same whatever they may be,0
@Sire Moyale Put your function right into module,0
@Sire Moyale You don't need that class,0
Because it does nothing in your case,0
Classes are just a way to organize your data and work with it,0
You have no data,0
Or any state,0
side note to self: a discussion of state might be a good intro to what OOP helps with,0
@Sire Moyale `import yourmodule`,0
`yourmodule.some_function(arguments)`,0
instead of `from yourmodule import funcclass``funcclass().some_function(arguments)`,0
That's just an awkward way to do that,0
What doesn't work?,0
first  your files have capital letters though,0
how do i make codeblocks display the code in in dfferent colors,0
"```py>> main.pyimport ostarget = r""""original = r""""current = os.getcwd()def func(target str_): os.chdir(target) try: f = open(""file.txt \'x\') except FileExistsError: pass f = open(""file.txt \'w\') f.write(str_) f.write(""\"") f.close return 0``````py>> test.pyimport mainmain.func(target=""C:/dest/to/file str_=""Hello"")```",1

i did the wrong copy paster but i fixed that alr thanks,0
@R1SK we can't help you with youtubedl sorry.,0
@Sire Moyale It's not a class but a module object,0
Like a separate namespace for all your functions etc,0
@Sire Moyale in your case it's just easier to import the module as a namespace and work with it instead of creating a class for something where you're just duplicating the namespace functionality of the module,1

Dumb question guys  if working with regular expressions from the re module is there a way to use look for sequences of (ab) like ab abab etc. without causing the (ab) to create a group in the resulting findall result / matchobject?Basically I want the functionality of the () parentheses without creating the objects.

so the user doesnt see it?,0
so i make assign the return function but i also need to make a variable for the function?,0
@lyc #ot0nikesonfeetmakemylovecomplete,0
Globals are OK for readonly values like constants or imports but not for things you modify,0
ok lemme get this straight a return function returns a value from the function but requires you to assign the function to a var.?,1
idk dude...1!!!,0
you're not obliged to assign a returned value to a variable it's just that that's the most common way to make use of a returned value,1
return has always been confusing for me,0
i've been trying to learn return for 4 daysa now,0
and it jsut doesnt add up for me,0
"@Deleted User do you know about getting the length of lists? `len([1,2,3])` gives you 3 right?",0
@Slow because globals quickly become unwieldy.,0
globals are horribly horrible,0
it seems convenient at first and then when you try to do something slightly more advanced they become a burden. You're best learning how to manage state by passing variables and returning values,1
@Slow because there are still cases as I mentioned above where you want to have some value in the global namespace typically readonly,1
"> @Deleted User do you know about getting the length of lists? `len([1,2,3])` gives you 3 right?@nedbat no it gives you 2. 0,1,2",1
but the vast majority of the time you don't want key parts of your program's state there,0
no it gives you 3 there are 3 elements at indexes 0 1 2.,0

oh wow didnt klnow thart was a thing,0
lol i needed a refresher i know all of the basics i forgot return ;;,0

that's not a beginner topic lol I didn't learn that until recently,0
bro,0

@marc fun fact there aren’t any native dictionaries in C. Python is quite nice in that sense,0
there isn't much native anything in C 🤔,0
wait what is a dictionary (in python ofc) and if its the basic def of dictionary in real life i didnt know dont kill me,1
Hahah exactly. You really notice how low level C is when trying it out,0
why should you use C if it doesnt have basic functions,0
also isnt C for front end?,0
> wait what is a dictionary (in python ofc) and if its the basic def of dictionary in real life i didnt know dont kill me@Deleted User a `dict` is something that links keys to values,1
@gm :GWsetmyxPeepoWeird:,0
I hate C with a damn passion. C is also kind of the universal language of computers,0
Imagine that you’re creating an operating system. You need to have good control over everything that’s happening,0
o,0
usually people use cpp for games. and python is great for data science since it's easy for data scientists who aren't programmers to pick up,1
C is fast gives you lots of control and have decades of libraries and support,0
But it's an awful language,0
oh im trying to do game development should i just learn c++...?\\,0
i mean i get you can do it with python but whats better,0
most of the time you can get C speeds by calling compiled code in python. in fact most number crunching modules (like numpy) do this,1
i've already spent so much time on python idk ...,0
Python is probably better for general usage sure. It can't compete with C in every situation though,0
of course not no language is better than everything else,0
so for game dev i should use c++?,0
Prip: Maybe. That depends on what you're trying to make,0
> i've already spent so much time on python idk ...@Deleted User how much time,0
Are you trying to make TicTacToe or GTA10?,0
Imagine that you’re creating an operating system. You need to have good control over everything that’s happening which you have in C. Python on the other hand gives you most of the things you need to get started. You can focus more on implementing the actual thing you want done than focusing on how the actual OS should handle it. However there are always pros and cons. You can’t simply use python for everything and call it a day,1
@gm a year and a half technically but i took a break and then came back which is why i lost so many programming brain cells,1
^,0
^^^,0
no i took a 3 month braek,0
and i jsut now took a few day break,0
If you're just learning how to program Python is such a great language. It mostly lets you focus on the logic instead of the boring stuff,1
i mean im still beginner,0
i dont want to switch thought im scared tbh,0
a year and a half is longer than i've been programming lol. for me it's a lot,0
Aren't the days of doing that over now since we're past C++11?,0
is it really?,0
welp i did a quick google search and on the top of the patge it says c++,0
sorry guys but i guess i gotta switch :/,0
wish me luck ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯,0
How can I wish you luck after you abandoned the Python way of life? :lemon_sentimental:,0

Good luck though,0
@appling a common pattern is a set of functions all of which take thee same struct as a first argument.,0
naw ian switching,0

Conway's Game of Life is kind of the embodiment of computer science. It's crazy,0

cython is problably the most funny name i've ever heard i cant lie,0
you can't write device drivers or OS kernels in Python,0
What do you mean by limits? The language has limits in the form of syntax. It's limited by not being compiled,1
But algorithmic complexity isn't one of its limits,0
I just gave two examples,0
algorithmic complexity is not related to the language you use,0
Exactly 😛,0
so uh why bring it up 🤔,0
about Web Scraping how can I get the class of a tag?,0
immago fr now k bye,0
about Web Scraping how can I get the class of a tag? I'm using BeautifulSoup,0
sorry,0
I pointed out some of the issues Python has because it's Python and then one where Python doesn't have limits due to being Python,1
🤔,0
something that isn't a limit is the fact that python has integers,0
Maybe you're looking for it in the wrong place. Try a help channel? You can post the error message there to get better help,1
how would you guys go about matching a variable in a list to a variable in another list,0
Do you mean checking to see if they hold the same value or checking to see if they're the same object?,1
"as in say i have this list ```pythonengalpha = [['A B C E F G'], ['H I J K L M'], ['N O P Q R S'], ['S T U V W X'], ['Y Z 1 2 3 4'], ['5 6 7 8 9 0']]``` and i want to find the locations of each item in this list ```python['H I T H E R E']```",1
as they correspond to the list engalpha,0
Why are you trying to do this? There might be an easier solution. Try running `ord('A')` then `ord('B')` and so on until you notice a pattern,1
i'm trying to build a basic translation software so i need the position of each item in the second list so i can apply it to the translated list and then print that final list,1
it's a bit confusing,0
@Deleted User what kind of translation do you mean? How does that give you a square board like this?,0
it's translating stuff to an alternate braille alphabet,0
so say A is inputted i want it to output ◦◦◦|◦◦◦,0

https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequencetypeslisttuplerange,0
"which corresponds to 0,0",0
in coordinates,0
There's a lot of useful information for working with lists in that link. That said maybe a list isn't the best way to go about doing this,1
what would you suggest?,0
@Deleted User it would be easier to make a dictionary that maps the input to the desired output,0
how should i go about that?,0
Depends on what you're doing. Maybe a tree maybe a dictionary or maybe something else,0
"@Deleted User `{""A"": ◦◦◦|◦◦◦ B"": ....`",0

Return is for when you want to get some value out of a function. It's used to store the result of some work that would otherwise be lost`y = f(x)` would store the value of f(x) in y,1

Passing?But yeah it's possible to return something and never store it in a variable,0
`if key in dict.keys() and dict[key] == val`?,0
so i have one last question how do i fetch the values in a dictionary for a set of keys contained in a list,1
`break` let's you interrupt some workI didn't know in Python but often times you'll see it used to get out of a loop when some condition is met but you Don't want to exit completely out of the function,1
@Rabbit You can use the `.get` method.,0
`a_dict.get(key) == value` if you know the `value` is not `None`,0
so i have my list ```python['Y M 0 4 P']``` and those are keys in my dictionary and i need to get the values for themhow would you suggest going about doing this?,1
@Deleted User you want to get values with these keys from dict?,0
yup,0
have a for loop?,0
Use list comprehension @Deleted User,0
^ that sounds better,0
Wait why do you need to get then?,0
What are you trying to do? Because to be honest you already have them inside of the dictionary,0
@Deleted User ```pydict_ = {}keys = ['Y M 0 4 P']values = [dict_[key] for key in keys]```,0
thanks,0
i've looked up list comprehension too and i'm going to do some more research on it,0
in the special case where you are also checking for `None` you can use an `object()`,0

@Real good question; yes that is true but if you only have a `pass` in your `else` block you can just omit it.,1

@layi A more serious issue may be depending on a lot of different versions of the same small package.

@Rozio on each iteration of a binary search you can eliminate half of the possible locations,0
new to programming too? @Rozio,0
Morning!,0
the list is sorted so all the values on the right of the median are greater and all the values on the left of the median are smaller @Rozio,1

wut is that?,0
hm,0
@Rozio the list is sorted so you know stuff about the list,0
@Rozio since you know the value of the median you can eliminate half the possible choices,0
yes any indices > 9 could have the value you're looking for,0

O(n  n) is O(n^2),0

hey,0
what's the big O of binary search?,0
(i'm asking rozio i know the answer),0
don't assume prove that it is,0
no not execution time @sfdsf,0
Who here has worked with both vsc and pycharm?,0
it's the time complexity. time complexity describes the rate at which your execution time grows as your input size grows. an O(n) algorithm will take 10 times longer for a 10 times bigger input,1

wait but isnt operator just function calls,0
Just a bad practice,0
There's no reason to use it in code,0
@Codec Using eval? Yes,0
You could execute malicious code,0

hence literal eval,0
!d ast,0
,0

because it can only evaluate native Python literals,0
what are things that are not native python literal?,0

> I mean you could do that with modules@1915 you could but you have control over the code you write.,0
the point of `eval` is that you're running code that you might not have written,0
@gm i googled a bit but there doesnt seem to be any mentioning of `native`,0

so if in python a string is a sequence of char and char is just multiple bytes then how is python string different than byte string?,1
i think i am one,0
"> so if in python a string is a sequence of char and char is just multiple bytes then how is python string different than byte string?@WelTrainedTango strings have the concept of encoding"".",1
which is basically a way to translate bytes into characters.,0
but char is bytes?,0
or not?,0
@WelTrainedTango In Python a string is a sequence of unicode codepoints. A bytestring is a sequence of bytes (integers from 0 to 255).,1
^^,0
so i read that a byte is just 8 bits,0
and everything are just bits right?,0
it is,0
hi,0
like float is 32 bit etc,0
"!e @WelTrainedTango ```pyfor char in привет"": print(ord(char) end= )print()```",0
@fix error :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```1087 1088 1080 1074 1077 1090 ```,0
doesn't fit in 8 bits 🙂,0
yea yea thats correct,0
whats that code?,0
so if byte string is a sequence of bytes which is just a sequence of bits,0
@WelTrainedTango for example `b'\\xc4\\xac'` is `Ĭ` in Unicode (UTF8) and `Ä¬` in CP1252.,0
okay think of it another way,0
i heard that String objects are boxed in python but like isnt the value inside the boxed type still bits?,0
what is the difference amongst the encodings?,0
> i heard that String objects are boxed in python but like isnt the value inside the boxed type still bits?@WelTrainedTango say you have a single byte `80`,1
that could represent the number 80 or the character `P`.,0
"@WelTrainedTango What do you mean by boxed""?",0
a string has a method to convert those raw bytes into specific characters,0
@fix error like boxed in java where you create a class to box the primitive type so that you could define methods on the box,1
which is called the encoding.,0
there are no primitive types in Python,0
> what is the difference amongst the encodings?@Deleted User the same byte maps to different characters basically.,0
"@WelTrainedTango Well there are no primitive types in Python. So... yes it\'s boxed"".",0
i save all my files in `UTF8`,0
so the encoding maps byte to string,0
by a set of rules,0
ohhhhh,0
yes basically.,0
but at the end of the day they are all bytes,0
thanks guys,0
is this correct?,0
well everything in your computer's memory is bytes,0
yea kinda,0
^^that is true,0
so whats the dif between encoding mapped string and byte string?,0
im assuming byte strings doesnt get mapped?,0
> so whats the dif between encoding mapped string and byte string?@WelTrainedTango what do you mean encoding mapped string,0
"> Can i just complain about How to code make best selling game in 5 minuts??? make billion dollar!!!!""@1915 i think u can",1
Discord lets you quote,0
so we have say byte 80 which gets mapped to character P following some mapping rulesets which is called encoding right?,1
> so we have say byte 80 which gets mapped to cahracter P following a map which is called encoding right?@WelTrainedTango kind...of.,1
does byte string also needs to be processed like this?,0
(strictly speaking that's `0x50` not 80),0
ohhhh,0
> does byte string also needs to be processed like this?@WelTrainedTango no bytes just are...raw bytes.,0
so they are like primitive type?,0
hm.,0
no not really,0
or is that not the correct term?,0
there are no primitive types in Python,0
@sfdsf If a string only contains ASCII CPython can optimize the string size.,0
but like how is a byte string different than a normal string in python then?,0
because i found this,0
wait i cant paste pics,0
you can post a link,0
`Assuming Python 3 (in Python 2 this difference is a little less welldefined)  a string is a sequence of characters ie unicode codepoints; these are an abstract concept and can't be directly stored on disk. A byte string is a sequence of unsurprisingly bytes  things that can be stored on disk. The mapping between them is an encoding  there are quite a lot of these (and infinitely many are possible)  and you need to know which applies in the particular case in order to do the conversion since a different encoding may map the same bytes to a different string:`,1
sry i just pasted it over from SO,0
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6224052/whatisthedifferencebetweenastringandabytestring,0
yeah isn't that pretty clear?,0
strings have encodings.,0
so my question is just if both string types are stored as bytes,0
it is,0
then how is it that the normal string cannot be stored on disk directly?,0
All strings are stored as bytes,0
disc,0
and why are they different?,0
> then how is it that the normal string cannot be stored on dick directly?@WelTrainedTango it cannot without its encoding,0
They can be.they mean u cant represent a physical character like A,0
okay think of it this way.,0
the string `'some string'` needs to be converted to bytes to be stored on disk.,0
the question of how to convert it is the encoding.,0
because your computer doesnt understand the lang we speak and type,0
Like the idea of A what it is etc is an abstract concept.bytes a representations of thos concepts.,0
without an encoding that's just abstract text,0
yea,0
so string + encoding > bytes that can be written to disk,0
Ohhh so normal string needs to be turned into Byte string to store them?,0
Think of encoding as just translating it into something the computer understandsLike A > too 1(i dont know what the actual value is soz),1
the default is usually `UTF8`,0
right?,0
yes,0
UTF8 is the standard today but there are others including ASCII,0
so whats the difference?,0
I thought normal string needs to be decoded to store as a data type then Byte string also needs to be decoded to store as another type,1
Between ASCII and UTF8?,0
> I thought normal string needs to be decoded to store as a data type then Byte string also needs to be decoded to store as another type@WelTrainedTango you don't need to do that manually.,1
any encoding to any encoding,0
so yea,0
> so whats the difference?@Deleted User the mapping.,0
Ah so only the encoding is different?,0
Each ASCII character is represented as 7 bits instead of UTF8 which is larger,0
the method through which it is written on the disk?,0
who wants to vc and chill while coding just wana make some friends,0
Actually ASCII and UTF8 are mostly the same,0
ohhhhh,0
(in terms of mapping),0
ohk,0
ASCII is a proper subset of UTF8 IIRC,0
im sure there is other stuff i dont know but the main thing is that UTF8 has more possible value because of a larger size,1
Much thank @gm,0
so mapping is the method in which the bytes are written on the disk,0
ig,0
sorta.I think ur over thinking this tbhUTF8 is a languageit maps characters that we understand too values the computer can understandhttp://www.asciitable.com/,1
> so mapping is the method in which the bytes are written on the disk@Deleted User not necessarily written to disk,1
dm me if u wana be python buddies im 14,0
if u want to store something on a computer it will take A turn it into its Unicode counterpart and then store that on the disk or some something with it,1
A is really just a representation of the number 65 for a computer,0
no,0
ohh,0
thanks guys,0
k gtg bye!,0
they do,0
the ascii code is just meant for humans to understand it easier,0
@Flash. encoding is a process,0
u can encode something to utf8,0

Async?,0
yea,0
Its just a way to do multiple things at once. sort of,0
Like threading,0
hmmmm,0
so how do i use it in my programs?,0
How it works is when u have a blocking process.for example like when ur waiting for data from the network you can switch and do something else while u wait,1
nothin intersting,0
You use the asyncio python module.,0
just noob stuff,0
ohhhh ok,0
it wont benefit u if u dont have a lot of blocking code,0
thats not a good explanation lol,0
oh ok,0

no i mean,0
r = 1,0
ohhh i got it now,0

and its not fair to use js here because they are refering to front end too,0
this study is stupid,0
its not fair to compare frontend js to python because pythons a BACKEND language,0
It's titiled top 5 and it has html in in and then there are 7 lannguages mentioned,0

how is the programmer going to know something went wrong with out probing the return value,0
should raise the error,0
I disagree whole heartedly.There is not a situation where this doesnt lead to some sort of coupling.Its not pythonic ever,0
Errors should never be silenced,0
yes,0
but there needs to be a good reason for it,0
all hes doing is returning an error message,0
@Flash. I dont care about the workings.error should be caught by higher level code imo,0
I mean ur right about the 100% point,0
thats another error,0
I dont even understand the traceback...Does ur app have 1949 lines?,0
Yeah I thought it was but I havent worked with flask before.I thought it might have been his app.,0
And generally the traceback starts with what u did wrong and then works backward,0
@Flash. How would you solve that problem about generating numbers with even digits though?,0
Yep,0
good way tho,0
^^^,0
@Flash.```pydef gen_numbers_with_even_digits(start: int end: int): even_numbers = 02468' seen = set() for i in range(len(str(start)) len(str(end)) + 1): for n in itertools.product(even_numbers repeat=i): if (number := int(''.join(n))) > end: break if number not in seen: seen.add(number) yield int(number)print(list(gen_numbers_with_even_digits(0 2000)))```,1
I think that would be pretty efficient,0
@Doctor `start: int` makes it except a int right?,0
nope,0
expect,0
just a type hint,0
Does nothing in a runtime,0
type hint as in?,0
never seen the syntax but I've heard of it,0
> type hint as in?@Deleted User wdym,0
What is type hinting.,0
On a runtime? Nothing. It's just a hints for you/ide/code checker,0
o,0
thats it?,0
thats sorta sad,0
for example if you try to pass argument with wrong type in this function PyCharm will tell you that function expects int instead of str,1
o thats actually pretty dope,0
Long function name ay 😂,0
@CodeKitten it's a type hint too,0
ited expect an object of discord.Member probs,0
no no,0
so everything in python is an object,0
or a better way to describe it is,0
everything is an instance of some class,0
so there is an int class and a str class etc,0
u could have an Animal class,0
and that would be an Animal data type,0
for the most part yeah,0
everything in python is an objectYou can check.take a integer variable and pass it to dir(),0
It will show you all the methods that are part of its instance,0
it just shows ur all the member attributes for a instance of a class,0
pretty sure it does it for classes as well,0
can anyone tell me how to uninstall a package?,0
cuz kivy isnt showing in my pycharm but when i install it through the terminal it says requirements already satisfied,0
hmph,0
what program language did snowden use?,0
@Deleted User its most likely because ur in a different vm,0
^^^,0
hm so how can i fix?,0
yeah i did `pip3 install kivy` already,0
it still doesnt work now im gonna do `pipwin install kivy`,0
oOo its happening,0
dk,0
@Deleted User it's because you're probably using virtualenv,0
I was thinking more along the lines of pycharm having just its own environment @o0o0keem it doesnt have to have anything to do with version mismatch,1
> @Deleted User it's because you're probably using virtualenv@Doctor no im not,0
or am i?,0

also u have too too use pytrhon,0
yeah im in now?,0
@Deleted User Send me screenshot of that window in dm,0
k,0
wut?,0
Whats the code supposed to do we need context?,0
u could return choice,0
instead of asking it from the global scope,0
but im not sure what ur trying to do,0
if there needs to be an outside variable for this code so other things can access it id probs lean towards putting it in a class.,1
but it really depends on what u implementation is,0
Can someone help #helpcookie pls,0
@Chris_ I don't think that applies to python 🙂,0
why would it not ?,0
because int has no max size in python,0
exactly python's int is BigInteger already,0
so you must not use `int`,0
NotLikeThis,0
@Manhera wut? lol,0
@kendalk08 i'm not very familiar with tkinter but you can pass dicts as function arguments + there's dict unpacking,0
yeah for key word arguments,0
just use `kwargs`,0
@kendalk08 https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/args_and_kwargs.html,0
@kendalk08 im confused what u mean,0
I told u how u do it,0
dict is how u unpack the dict into the values,0
variables,0
arguments?,0
just put two  infront of the variable,0
@kendalk08 i told u how to unpack a dictionary.thats what u asked isnt it?,0
@Chris_ context?,0
```dict = {'arg1': 1 arg2': 2 arg3': 3}myfunction(dict)^ this will unpack dict intoarg1 = 1arg2 = 2arg3 = 3```,0
iffff,0
there is a kwargs argument,0
if there isnt,0
u can still do it,0
just need to know the names of the variables,0
or u can just use regular unpacking,0
`args`,0
@kendalk08 but its not getting passed as a dict,0
ur unpacking it,0
thats what the  syntax is,0
@Chris_ I think you must operate with strings then,0
@kendalk08 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWY4BZi_o28,0
Or limit your ints to 2^631,0
I misunderstood ur question I'm sorrydo u want to rephrase it?,0
@kendalk08 You could define init methods in your classes you know?,0
Also u can use  syntax in any function that accept vairables,0
@kendalk08 Can you at least give us a code example? 🙂,0
Whats the problem @kendalk08 U still havent rephrased?,0
@epic guy Why do you want to do that in a first place?,0
@epic guy u can use dir(),0
but not sure if thats the best method,0
dir(class_or_instances),0
@kendalk08 What add_command does?,0
will return the namespace of passed object,0
like all the methods variables etc,0
u could probs do something with hasinstance tho maybe?,0
ik there is a function to check this but im not sure what it is,0
"@kendalk08 Why are you using string in that case? `f""partial(self.changeItem {i})""`",0
@kendalk08 I wasn't speaking to u as if ur new?I just didn't understand ur question and tbh u still havent reexplained what the problem is?,1
If you do eval it then it's a bad way to do that,0
ehm,0
not really,0
You could just use lambda,0
Or leave it as partial but why the hell it is a string,0
@kendalk08 Omg we're just trying to figure out your problem and how to solve it,0
Because i don't see a reason why it must be done in that awkward way,0
@kendalk08 actually anything can accept  syntax as long as u use the same variable names.but doesnt really matter.,0
what are u actually writing?,0
it seems to me like ur making some sort of gui maker???could be wrong,0
🔼,0
it just is weird?why wouldnt u just build it manually,0
Just what are you trying to write,0
and what it should do?,0
hmm,0
✅ silenced current channel for 10 minute(s).,0
✅ unsilenced current channel.,0
@Bast was that person self botting?,0
@Bast Sorry wasnt aware.,0
ohh they were,0
i see,0
@kendalk08 You could compose multiple elements into one though,0
So it will make more sense on it's own,0
Aren't you listening?,0
How that i told you will not allow you to have 1k messages in your app?,0
that guy gone?,0
or was he reported to discord?,0
mhm,0
ofc ofc,0
@Bast Will it even work since it's a string?,0
@kendalk08 The way you trying to store your chat messages or something is very very bad since you refer to them by ids and doing other weird stuff,1
@kendalk08 Could you learn more about oop before creating this app?,0
Should be easier 🤔,0
Plus you know that you could create class like `MessageList` that will display say list of `Message` widgets?,0
Both of them should be widgets though,0
re.sub,0
Could you list characters that you want to delete?,0
@kendalk08 lmao i do,0
@Bast https://paste.pythondiscord.com/yuxowebeya.rb,0
not in that way 🙂,0
wdym? > i want to retain mautd vs liepzig@sh0rtcircu1t000,0
@orpheus you dontneed jupyter,0
anaconda is just a python kernel with a bunch of pkgs,0

@sh0rtcircu1t000 Create regular expression that will match unwanted characters (You could use https://regex101.com/ for example to test your regular expressions)Then use it in re.sub method,1

i linked the docs,0
and installation of ipython kernel instructions,0
@kendalk08 Everything is as i said. Imagine your messages as standalone objects or widgets wouldn't it be easier to manipulate with them as a whole instead of a bunch of labels and buttons?,1
tbh i have no idea why you would want ipython without jupyter i think its developed for interactive experiences which is jupyter,1
i should probbly start using pip i have yet to successfully install any pkgs with pip,0
i just conda everything in the GUI lol,0
@kendalk08 You still can modify them separately 😉,0
i recommend anaconda with jupytert,0
or just google collab tbh lol,0
jupyter is a notebook,0
it supports R cells python cells and markdown cells,0
which menas you could run all of these in a single notebook,0
and each notebook contains multiple cells that could be of different type,0
no very different,0
you will never need it if you dont data science or statistics,0
then why not just get anaconda,0
its like the default,0
anaconda is a python distribution that contains a custom python kernel + statistics related pkgs + jupyter lab + jupyter notebook + R related stuff,1
it also has built in pkg manager and venv,0
the default,0
toolkit,0
you could also try google collab which is another interactive notebook dedicated for data science,0
but its allows collaboration more easily and gives you the hardware to train and compute,0
or you could also set up your own jupyter notebook server etc i ve never done this tho,0
lol,0
yeah its up to you,0
@Qwerty thats a huge markdown file,0
im always amazed at how fast jupyter cells gives output,0
like in vsc or pycharm i hit run then i wait,0

okay thank u,0
lol all hail nedbat,0
> I hear alot of people talking about dictionaries in chat.> What are they?Any help?,0
Isnt it something to do with numbers tho? Or lists,0
you would have to store the time that you entered the item then scan the db every second or so to remove any items that are too old,1
I think there is a module called dictionary,0
sure that might work,0

@Olli you could split the input however i don’t think you could have it saying `Username: foo Password: foo` instead it would be something like `Username and Password: foo foo`,1

most distros uses same directory hierarchy,0

@pratt,0
dm me,0
since the string is all digits you can use the `int` function to convert the strings to integers,0
then you can add them to your variable,0
hi,0
when you say `for i in digits` `i` is assigned to each value of `digits` which means that you don't need to use `digits[i]`,1
no that's not guido,0

@Nabobery pinging you here because you closed before i could send itmost data structures and algorithms books/courses will teach in pseudocode. the point of these classes/courses is for you to implement the things you learn in a language of your choice. if you don't know a programming language you'll have a rough time learning data structures and algorithms,1
"> ```py> strDigits = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20""> digits = []> digits = strDigits.split()> sum = 0> > for i in digits:> int(i)> sum += i> > print(sum)> ```@afuroh",1
make it up as you go,0
and be consistent,0
sorta like a programming language but you can't run it,0
pretty much,0
there\'s no pseudocode standard you can make whatever pseudocode you want,0
like i could say `tnseraiovkcseaistra > print` outputs hello world,0
the only reason to use pseudocode is to tell other people about it so that's not a good idea,0
the same you don't want to use `print` in one spot and `System.out.println()` in another spot,0

how do i make my program not shut down when im finished,0
just keep the program open,0

sure,0

yeah bc you should write it in one [],0
lists are nice for storing data that's similar for example:```pycolors = ['red green blue']```,0

Thanks for the info! ♥️,0
@Aboo Minister part of me wants to build something like instagram WhatsApp or something like that. Then there's a part of me that wants to just build desktop applications that may not require data science,1
Recently i was on DataCamp and noticed they're teaching data science,0
But i don't think i want that,0
@Aboo Minister so i stopped script and i was gonna run and it says this command. @client.command(name='irrelevant')NameError: name client is not defined,1
@Aboo Minister what should i learn about python other than data science? Is there any other option?,0
I'm so confused,0

@eivl how should i chnage it?,0
How would you go about combining the value of variables to a variable? Say...``x = 1Y = 2 Z = 2 and 1``,1
Like if I wanted a variable to have multiple variables in it,0
@EmpressMaia that sounds like you're talking about a list,0
"```pyx = 1y = 2z = [x,y]z>>> [1,2]```",0
I'm trying to make a ecosystem simulation where like there is a set amount of grass and waterAnd 10 sheepsSo I would have each individual hunger and thirst. Then depending on their hunger and thirst a amount is subtracted from the water and grass,1

Is Python going to be fast in the future?,0
Like C++,0
@Deleted User you can already do things that will speed up Python significantly: use PyPy Numba Cython third party C/C++ libraries etc.,1
Idk why c++ is so fast and other programming languages is faster than python,0
Python is interpreted and the flexibility it affords the programmer comes at the cost of raw execution speed,0
@CodingXeer in python,0
Help is claimed check #helpcandy,0
Lol,0
but again you can take steps to speed up many Python apps to get within striking distance of C/C++,0
can you check copper,0
help copper,0
What is the benefit of being interpreted?,0
i sent a picture,0
Could I use index positions in a list to change variables?,0
@Deleted User again flexibility afforded to the developer. They trade raw execution speed for development speed,0

What's the best way to format strings?,0
@Toaster in most cases I’d recommend using fstrings,0
"Hey I want to convert a list like this :[['nm0000131 John Cusack'], ['nm0000154 Mel Gibson'], ['nm0000163 Dustin Hoffman']]",0
to,0
a dictionary,0
where like the first value corresponds as a key,0
and the name thing becomes a value,0
You could use a dict comprehension. Do you know how they work @Invictus ?,0
"{'nm0000131': John Cusack', nm0000154': Mel Gibson', nm0000163': Dustin Hoffman'}",0
I mean something like this,0
@Kilier have you heard about `input()`?,0
"```python@bot.eventasync def on_member_join(member): channel = member.guild.get_channel(727598080739770531) message = f""Bienvenue\{member.name}"" await EasyPil(channel member img/on_join.jpg (322 322 153 153 0) None None message wloc=(950 10)) ``` can someone know why it don\'t work please?",1
That basically gives you whatever the user has inputted and returns it. Once you get that input you can simply assign it to a variable,1
it never arrive to the fonction 😭,0
"Here’s an example of this: ```pyname = input(""what’s your name?"")```",0

ok,0

!projects I’d recommend trying some of these ideas out as well,0

> @Vestergurkan > ```python> for i in range (len(pathData)):> pathDict[pathData[i][0]] = pathData[i][1]> ```> I did this and it works fine^ (pathData is the list)@Vestergurkan,1
is this fine?,0
If it works it works but I find it slightly messy,0
I find the indices to be hard coded,0
does anyone know a good python course with good visual lessons,0
I would personally have use the dict comp that I shared earlier,0
okay alright,0
thank you,0
@Invictus instead of doing range(len()),0
just do `for obj in pathData` but with a better variable name,0
do we have a tag for why range(len()) is bad?,0

Idk one bit about python but I'm lookin to learn soon,0
noice,0
python is fun,0
esspacially if your making graphics and programming ur own game,0
im gonna learn if statement,0
What can i do with python tho? Thats what im excited about!,0
esspecialy,0
especially,0
wow,0
> @Deleted User Can't we say learnt ?@Yeeks 🤔,0
im learning tkinter graphics right now,0
"> I thought I could say You learnt me something""No that doesn\'t make sense",0
how do u make apps i can only do IDLE,0
I mostly use PyCharm for larger projects. The best part about it is probably that it tells me some nice things like if I make a silly mistake like writing `if x != True`,1
@Marko.exe i knew that but what could these codes be used for?,0
@Deleted User you can work very well with data and it is easy and fast to write but its not made for game dev,1
`if x = false`😆 I don't know if I have made a silly mistake like `if x != true`,0
Like as in how do i finally impress my friends? What should i make first?,0
dir(x),0
> `if x = false`> > 😆 I don't know if I have made a silly mistake like `if x != true`@Deleted User just to clarify the best way of writing it would be `if not x`,1
@Deleted User if you want to impress do a gui project,0
@Amuri oki,0
should i learn bash?,0
y am i not banned yet?,0
but if you REALLY want to impress make a game with pygame or if you want professionell game dev lear c # and unity @Deleted User,1
I do that thx,0
but i would recommend first learning python and then maybe c sharp,0
using pycharm is sometimes annoying for some reason its not working correctly anymore,0
i use version 3.7.9,0
Oh ok 🤩,0
am i the only one with problems on pycharm?,0
`if not true` `if not false`,0
There is no `else if` so there is `elif` right?,0
no there were others who had linting problems or syntac errors where there werent rlly errors @Deleted User,0
> using pycharm is sometimes annoying for some reason its not working correctly anymore@Deleted User what’s the problem with it?,0
Ok,0
idk i use a book that uses a older version of python and i type in the exact command and it even explains what its supposed to do but pycharm sometimes doesnt do it,1
my dad says its another problem but idk,0
@Deleted User are you using a book written for Python 2?,0
but you do you get any errors?,0
@Mike_P thanks for the reply i am not sure i am just starting to use visual studio code to learn i am hoping to do more with data analysis,1
idk i honestly just found the book,0

my pip isn't updated and i am really confused how to update it,0
@Deleted User You could also try describing a specific example of this happening and we can try to figure out what's causing it.,1
@pickpie python m pip install –upgrade pip in the cmd,0
@Deleted User do you get any errors when you run your code,0
@Infinimata honestly i think its just the version and my dad could fix it hes been programming for 4 years anyhow thx for helping,1
no i dont get errors,0
or nothing,0
but what hapens,0
proces finished with exit code 0,0
Exit code 0 means success,0
ok,0
So it terminated without errors,0
ik it does but its not a succes according to me because it didnt do what it was supposed to,0
yes it terminated without errors,0
so i should type python m pip install –upgrade pip what about python3 m pip install –upgrade pip,0
its the same i believe,0
So what did it do and what did you expect it to do? It would also help if you showed your code.,1
but like i said my dads gotten it taken care of,0
dont waste ur time on me,0

where did you type it in,0

it should be `U` (capital U),0
that's great it worked!  but how did you know that. lol,0
If the URL starts with https they use ssl.,0
i should learn bash?,0
@pickpie always google as a programmer,0
thats how you succseed and get a job lol,0
honestly i googled it and got in over my head,0

@Monky So you want to find the last two values?,0
@Mike_P the syntax of the function's agrument parameter . It says top: then union[anystr pathlike[anystr]],0

@MahanBi The most common reasons why PyInstaller packaged apps don't work is because some thirdparty dependency wasn't automatically packaged with it.When you first run PyInstaller on a project it generates a .spec file that's in your projects root directory. With that you can customize future runs of PyInstaller to do things like include imports that it doesn't detect properly.https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/specfiles.htmlThat doc goes into how spec files can be generated reused edited etc. They're the key to making PyInstaller work right.I'd als recommend using PyInstaller without the `onefile` option because otherwise it makes debugging difficult until you get everything running.It also helps to compile apps with the console enabled and to run the resulting .exe from the command line so you can see any error output printed to the console. This includes things like potential missing imports or other files that weren't bundled with the app.,1

Hello!I have one problem to solve that I can't find a good solution to let me break it down for you.I want to create a HTTP session in where I bulk download content from a particular site by visiting multiple content tags.The issue is that the site uses a pagination system which kinda breaks my current way of web scraping because the pagination system isn't counting pages from `1` to whatever each page has a unique ID and I know how to overcome this problem by scraping a link which leads to a next page but here's the thing... I want my program to query over a list of tags and scrape data until the pagination has ended no more pages left to scrape content from how would I do this without creating utterly bad code?```pywith requests.Session() as sess: for tag in tags: # My fancy scraping where we find out about the next page... next_page = soup.find('a alt='next').get('href') while next_page is not None: # My once again fancy scraping... # Scrape the contents```,1

@Sam there's a Cython addon,0
Rats,0
Cython user here,0
If you're using a C module to do the recognition there's not likely to be a speedup,0
@Sam the biggest speedups are always going to come from tight loops with strong numerical types,0
"```pyfavorite_places = { eric': ['disneyland school mall toy store',] adrian': ['hollywood france stadium gym',] nicolas': ['mountain park playground north carolina',]}```i have a syntaxerror for the line with adrian':",1
@SubGplayz,0
@Sam post your code?,0
ty it worked,0
@Sam generally when you use Cython you use it to optimize hot code the part of the code that is most aggressively looped over. The first step I recommend with any of this is to perform some profiling to determine where your code spends most of its time and optimize that for the biggest win. Indiscriminately converting to Cython does not help,1
why am I supressed?,0
why acn't I talk,0
@Sam the way I've done this is I take the part of the code that is a loop place it into a .pyx and import that into my main code. one other key thing is to keep as much of the looping as possible in Cython  don't call a Cythonized function repeatedly in a loop from Python because then you lose a lot of performance going back and forth across the PythontoC bridge,1
@LorenzoThePasta probably slow mode u have to wait 10s before each message,0
@Sam correct. `.pyx` gets built into C/native libraries from which you can import transparently,0
@Sam again this is why you focus on only converting hotspot functions.,0
> who wanna help me i am a starter@MilfSlayer what's up? Ask away.,0
you want to convert the things for which you will reap the biggest rewards and those tend to a few spots in the code where most of the action is.,1
and the best way to find out where those are is to profile.,0

yea,0
Yeah check the code,0
:popbitch:,0
a numpy array?,0
yes,0
but its not made for making games,0
you would need to install a library called pygame or kivy,0
@Odaline A bunch of people have. It's easy if you ask your question rather than asking if someone knows a module.,1
only simple ones,0
Well... what's your project? What are you trying to do?,0
if you want to make 3d fps shooters learn c sharp and unity engine or unreal engine,0
can you make professional applications with tkinter,0
You can but generally people will use better libraries like pyqt/pyside2,0
whats pyqt,0
@Zalmoxix you didn't mention different sections in the first description,0
Pyqt is a python framework that binds to the Qt C++ framework. It lets you make GUIs and it has a lot of strong features and functionality,1
but it uses the python prgoramming langage correct?,0
@Odaline I would recommend tkinter + matplotlib or pyqt + pyqtgraphs then for displaying data and having an interface people can interact with if you're set on using python,1
> Yeah check the code@Deleted User i dont think it is it says pyarmor something something,0
@Deleted User Yup the pyqt is a binding so you use python code and it'll interpret it to the correct c++ code to call what you need,1
@Morning I am not talking about games I think some conversations might have gotten crossed. Pygame is definitely a good starting place though. You can also check out Arcade or Panda3D.,1
YES! and that is better than tkinter correct? does it have a good gui look as well? like better than tkinters 80s look :GWsetmyxPeepoWeird:,1
@Deleted User You can style tkinter to look good but pyqt will have some material design elements out of the box and look a bit more modern,1
okay thanks @kutiekatj9 😄,0

`if string in my_list`,0
@kutiekatj9 i think so i thikn its built in with pyqt5 tho,0
@kutiekatj9 ius it okay if i send the video link?,0
This is generally what I recommend to beginners in pyqt I think it covers the basics of the framework reasonably well: <https://www.learnpyqt.com/courses/start/>Your editor won't make a difference for coding and sure.,1

VSCode is an editor. PyCharm is an IDE,0
o\\,0
In its essence IDEs are Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and come packed with a lot of the features you may need without you specifying exactly what you’re looking for.

hello how i make my dice rolling simulator says what player won?,0

oh wow,0
i didnt know that,0

i created a list with first number 1 and the last 6,0
and used random.choice() to choose one number from that list,0
what i did was bad?,0
@Deleted User It's not but but it isn't optimal,0
If you want to choose number from certain range you could use random.randint,0
looks like i need change my code oof,0
@Deleted User What's your current code though?,0
"```import random````print('Loading...')````print('Hi this is a dice roll simulator code')print('write \\'enter\\ on input to begin')user1 = str(input('Write command here,player 1'))user2 = str(input('Write command here,player 2'))dc = [1 2 3 4 5 6]def dice1(a): if a == enter': return random.choice(dc) else: print('Error try again')def dice2(a): if a == enter': return random.choice(dc) else: print('Error try again')```print('Player1:{}'.format(dice1(user1)))print('Player2:{}'.format(dice2(user2)))",1
@Deleted User You have two identical functions,0
They do the same thing so you can remove one of them,0
my logic is that each function would work for each user,0
Yeah my logic at that situation was pretty bad,0
@Deleted User But you can make one function that will work for each user 🤔,0
That's what function parameters for essentially  so functions can work with different data,0
I will try that,0
@Deleted User Also you should split your code properly so one functions doesn\'t do two things,0
Want to verify user input? Generate dice roll? Perfect do it in different functions,0
@Deleted User Also you're converting input() result to a string what is unnecessary because input() returns string,0
@Deleted User ```pyimport randomdef roll_dice(): return random.randint(1 6)def is_command_valid(command): return command == enter'print('Loading...')print('Hi this is a dice roll simulator code')print('write \\'enter\\ on input to begin')user1_input = input('Write command here player 1: )user2_input = input('Write command here player 2: )if all([is_command_valid(user1_input) is_command_valid(user2_input)]): print('Player1: {}'.format(roll_dice())) print('Player2: {}'.format(roll_dice()))else: print('One of users typed wrong command!')``` you can write something like this,1
You don't really need second function but you might change it at some point,0
(i'm talking about `is_command_valid`),0
I will fix that,0
@Deleted User also you don't need any arguments for roll_dice now,0

Quick question what's gonna be faster line intersection ray casting with a self balancing binary search tree or this:https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/755631235488940053/771237602014658600/unknown.png?width=1203&height=677,0
what is your issue @suid,0
line equations,0
math is the bane of my existence,0
same,0
> the second is faster  you step exactly to the points you need to check@salt I thought that would be the case... except I've done the thing and now it lags quite a bit with 120 lines,1
```pydef ray_casting(sc player_pos player_angle): cur_angle = player_angle  HALF_FOV xo yo = player_pos for ray in range(NUM_RAYS): sin_a = math.sin(cur_angle) cos_a = math.cos(cur_angle) for depth in range(MAX_DEPTH): x = xo + depth  cos_a y = yo + depth  sin_a #pygame.draw.line(sc DARKGRAY player_pos (x y) 2) if (x // TILE  TILE y // TILE  TILE) in world_map: break cur_angle += DELTA_ANGLE```This is called every frame,1
I thought it could be pygame graphics slowing things down but even removing the draw function it still slows when I have too many rays,1

hm,0
lol this guy created his account 5 days ago,0
```pydef mydecorator2(): passdef mydecorator(): mydecorator2()``` is that a valid decorator?I would assume not,0
the only examples i've seen use a wraps thing,0
```pydef deco(to_wrap): def wrapped(args kwargs): print('decorated function being called') return to_wrap(args kwargs) return to_wrap# use it like this:@decodef f(a b): return a + b# which is the same as:def f(a b): return a + bf = deco(f)```,1

I believe you mean `functools.wraps` which basically copies the docstring and some other stuff but isn't particularly relevant,0

@xtremedevx,0
so first you generate the fibonacci sequence,0
then you have an input assign it to a variable,0
check if the input is valid,0
then you get the fibonacci freeze of it (whatever that means i have no clue),0
don't give answers help them understand,0

wats the difference between a console and a terminal?,0
`The console is a terminal. A system has got one console and potentially multiple terminals. The console is typically the primary interface for managing a computer eg while it is still booting up.A terminal is a session which can receive and send input and output for commandline programs. The console is a special case of these.A TTY is essentially a pseudo device call it a kernel resource which is used by processes to access a specific terminal. TTYs can be tied to hardware such as a serial port or can be virtual eg created when a user logs in via a network`,1

not just while my pc is booting up,0

Hey all I'm trying to further my understanding on something but I'm lacking the computer science background necessary to know the term for what I'm doing (making it hard to google). This may be a better way to get a clear answer so I thought I'd give it a shot.I was given a problem yesterday we get a twos complemented integer (64bit) and we need to convert it to a 64bit hexadecimal. The hex should always be 16 characters but sometimes it comes out as 17 characters:for example: start int: 6529224006068503387 output hex: 15a9c76a3e4aa835b code: ```def return_hexed_integer(n): return hex((1 << 64) + n)[2:] ```The correct output (as proved by QA who doesn't know why but just knows it is is: 5a9c76a3e4aa835b (no leading 1) )And it's driving me mad because I don't want to just do [16:] without understanding why,1

@Biz it's also unambiguous what your intention is when you use an F string.,0

at any rate: if you want to have the least surprising effects when formatting results use an F string,0

@KevinDev my point exactly,0
the momentary convenience of implicit concatenation is far outweighed by how it turns into a time bomb,0

it's a problem even for experts,0
because they often have far more important things to think about in an advanced code base,0

well its not a thing anymore,0
because `async` is a reserved keyword im pretty sure,0
since python 3.7,0

no because you cant name a method `async` anymore since its a reserved keyword since 3.7,0

Yeah that's what I mean.,0
Still it's a lot better than if elif elif elif elif elif elif,0
You can make a dictionary of functions programmatically no need to do any typing things out then,0
Indeed however it's a lot better on the eyes.,0
Huh? I'm talking about replacing```pyif case0: f(x)elif case1: g(x)```,0
Use lambdas,0
I can't live without metaprogramming lol,0
,0
Hello. How can I define an operator on function type? My python interpreter says `type(f)` where f is an arbitrary function is like `class  function'` but the following code produces NameError:```pydef fcompose(f g): return lambda x: f(g(x))function.__xor__ = fcomposeflip = lambda f: lambda x: lambda y: f(y)(x)f = lambda x: lambda y: x  yg = flip ^ fprint(g(5)(6))```,1
Does offensive python have a python3 edition yet? The problem I had with that book is the copy I had kept asking me to use python2 tools.,1
Ye i've tried that,0
Basically you need to use the language that would be be used in aa school.,0
If you want to learn something learn how we speak about it and we'll be able to tell your intentions,0
I have a question... at one point do you people stop doing error checking or assertions? Or how do you design your classes? ```pyclass Thing: # Meant for public use def insert(obj): ...error checking... def _insert(obj): ... assume only valid input ...```,1
yeah html is just plaintext.,0
Is something like that the canonical way of doing things?,0
You can use Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing,0
<https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>,0
`html.parser` is more basic. BS4 is more about selecting.,0

thats good to know,0
He's talking about access to methods. Private and public are keywords very important to langs like Java,0
It reaches into the system environment for a value so that the value is not contained in the code,0

it's a bit unintuitive,0
yeah you can't use a starred expression there,0

@Artemis ask in #gamedevelopment,0
Any valid not reserved name,0
any name that's not a reserved word and beware of overloading existing builtins,0
Man you can use decorators everywhere,0
@arsco VS Code may be complaining about the space between `randint` and the `(` which is not recommended style,0
@Hoopefully it can be used for games although not stuff like Call of Duty or whatnot,0
@arsco post your full code?,0
there's always ways to speed Python quite effectively though,0
there's PyPy yes but a) it uses a great deal more memory than CPython b) its warmup time for max speed is considerable so it's best for cases where you have a longrunning server,1
If you want a fast language with advantages of python you should have a look at Haskell.,0
@Biz one scenario in my case is wrapping each endpoint in a web API with user verification,0
@Infinimata https://chrispenner.ca/posts/pythontailrecursion,0
Decorator usage example ↑,0
@Aboo Minister that just seems like you're not providing the right file path to your grammar,0
@Slow i mean to send that to you. https://chrispenner.ca/posts/pythontailrecursionHere's an example of decorator usage,0
@Aboo Minister you also don't specify `start`,0
@asdf.py you can use lambas where the function is needed without creating a named function,0
Do you now modules to start and stop mp3 files?,0
is there a module to play and pause mp3 files?,0
hey im kinda of a noob where do i ask questions ?,0
`NNNUMBER` ?,0
that looks like a typo,0
@Aboo Minister oh it might be the import hold on,0
Shortly lambdas are convenient way to pass functions as arguments to high order functions.,0

@Aboo Minister they just pushed a release a couple of days ago so I wonder if this is a bug.,0

@Aboo Minister OH!,0
@Aboo Minister hm I suppose that's because your import doesn't include `NUMBER` as such,0

@moanie no,0
Google what are static methods,0
@Aboo Minister there ya go!,0
@Aboo Minister at some point I want to come back to my own language project but I do need to read up some more on language design first.,1
> w3schools@asdf.py i use this more for like a reference place,0
Oop in python is a set of hacky abstractions so if you want to write oostyle you shoukd look for other languages,1
@Biz I was yes  sort of in limbo now. Other more immediate projects took precedence,0
Yeah and it's things like the standard library that are the real timesinks. The actual language itself is not the real project,1
"I decided to stick with Python for now for the sake of productivity,.",0
@asdf.py what about it?,0
😂,0
@asdf.py I don't use it,0
@Biz the slowest part of the compiler I found was nothing on the Python side. It was LLVM,0
It has nothing to do with productivity,0
Yeah LLVM is very much a world unto itself but I was fond of the challenge.,0
It was language design that I had the real obstacle with,0
I kinda don't like when language enfoces indent rules on me but it's really doesn't matter,0
> less typing also stops people from making absurd oneliners 😛@Biz Oh you havent seen #esotericpython,0
yeah an interpreter is a fine start,0
Horrible one liners and just dreadful code,0

> I was looking how to do it on an async function or smth@Deleted User discord.py has converters,0
converters . . .,0
dont post your question in multiple channels 😅,0
yea. . .,0
converts let you convert their input from a string to the required datatype,0
ah ok,0
It looks similar to type hitning,0
```py@bot.command()def foo(ctx a: int b: int): pass```Will convert a and b to int,0
or try to and fail fro incorrect input,0
why,0
discord.py has cogs for that right?,0
i havent seen commands.Bot being subclassed,0
Raise an error if its not integers,0
```pydef abc(one : int two : int): if isinstance(one str): raise Exception() return one + two```,0
right,0
```pydef abc(one : int two : int): if not isinstance(one int): raise TypeError() return one + two```,0
> well cogs would be a different thing@Biz what do you do with subclassing commands.Bot?,0

I see,0
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯,0
I hate type hinting,0
Never get it correct,0
@moanie inherit from Exception,0
OKay then type hinting question coming up,0
```pydef abc(one : list[str] two: list[int]) > list[Union[str int]]: return one + two```,0

no,0
mypy will give you an error,0
i know thats not the problem,0

What do you mean by that exactly? Python code is in general slower than compiled languages,0
BUT are they slow compared to ther parts of Python? No,0
Also IIRC you can use iterators which are wrappers to C code so they go much faster,0
But someone else would have to verify that,0
Keep in mind that regex just simply is good for some types of parsing,0
So make sure you're not trying to parse something that regex can't handle,0

oh,0
hm,0
so,0
i want it like in some instances of a class the func can be defined but in some cases it wont be defined like that we hv to do?,1
what?,0
didn't get that sorry,0
like i hv a dictionary in which there are instances of classes so,0
"```pycmd_dict = { >help"": Command("">help   same thing like down), >oh"": Command(""oh FUCK OFF this is optional will giv error oh a func)}``` this is the dict so now i want to hv an optional arg like for now this iwill giv me error",1

Seems like a perfect time to ask...,0
you could use `is 0`,0
since CPython 🤔,0
Is there any way to check what the length of an iterator object should be? Since I'm using `map` the size of the element shouldn't change```py def add(cs r s): if len(cs) % 2 == 0: cs = f'{cs[:1]}{cs[2]:}' return map(lambda x y: cs[x:y] r s)```I'm trying to come up with a avoid turning this into a list,1
Are there any better solutions?,0
I could call different functions depending on if it's an odd or even iteration but I'm trying out different options ATM,1
What are lambda functions used for?,0
Question how high of math do u need to be in order to get a job for python?,0
TBH I never I even thought of that. Duh it seems to simple now,0
Ah didn't even know that was a thing lol 😂😂,0
Hmm... I was going to move the map to the next part where there's multiple results and copy the last portions if necessary but won't that eat up the interator?,1
@PureFunctor :warning: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```[No output]```,0
Which would require two copies of it,0
"so im getting selenium set up and i have this so far but i get an error when i try to run it that the path is wrong any ideas? ```pythonfrom selenium import webdriverPATH = /home/username/ChromeDrivers/chromedriver_linux64/chromedriver""driver = webdriver.Chrome(PATH)driver.get(""https://google.com"")```",1
I already have a version that checks the even or oddness of the loop since that's all that's needed,0
Right now I'm trying to work on fusion or whatever Python calls it,0
Btw what does map function do? Never heard of it,0
`map(f xs) == [f(xs[0]) f(xs[1]) ... f(xs[1])]`,0
Assuming xs is a map,0
this is the error File /home/username/Documents/BAT_GRAB/BAT_GRAB.py line 3 in <module>,0
Umm,0
anyone know how to fix?,0
Still don't get what map is lol,0
You give it a function and a list of things to apply it to,0
It applies that function to everything in the list,0
Hmm,0
_Technically_ that's not quite true though. In Python it gives you an iterator or whatever they're called,0
The end result is what I said though,0
Wait a sec from that code why us.append(f(x)) doesn't it make it the f be undefined?,0
ys not us D:,0
```list(map(lambda n: add(1 n) range(10)))[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]```,0
There's the result of running it,0
Last question what does lambda do? 😂😂,0
It makes up a function on the spot,0
```f = lambda n: n + 1f(0)1```,0
Didn't know lol so it's a function just like define right?,0
Yeah but used when you don't really need to define a whole big function,0
So then from that u can just call n() any where? Or it not quite the same,0
```pyf = lambda n: n + 1def g(n): return n + 1```,0
Those two are the same thing,0
The `n` is a parameter `f` and `g` are the function names,0
Got it,0

Place your breakpoints in actual code that you want to debug,0
oh i use vsc and I don't get what u mean @o0o0keem,0
k,0
@24orlandito Can you at least show your code in help channel? Also ping me in it,0
I was given some problems to make codes for and i need some help with the third one. I know how to solve it but the code will be very big so I need to know if there is a shorter way to do this:You will be given 20 values and u have to find out the highest and the lowest value after sorting all the numbers in ascending order.,1
`stuff`,0
works for me,0

please?,0
yeah,0
we were told to do what we needed to but we needed to solve them,0
using python,0
im still a beginner so I dont know much,0
what does indexing mean,0
> Then just `sorted(list reverse=True)` will do the sorting@Jac_k ```pythondef out_of_20(a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t): list = (a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t) sorted(list reverse=True)```Is this much ok,1
Why is JS claimed to be 75 times faster than python? Is this confirmed or just the negligence of async in python which comes default with node?,1
> Why is JS claimed to be 75 times faster than python? Is this confirmed or just the negligence of async in python which comes default with node?@Soviet Spy claimed by whom and in what context?,1
> If an error is raised in the middle of a loop iteration and i excepted the error would `continue` continue running the code from where it left off when the error was raised?@CodeKitten `continue` means next iteration of loop,1
Q u o r a,0
Yeah someone was tripping,0
@CodeKitten show code,0
or an example,0
but if I understand you correctly yes `pass` would work,0
like if you just want to swallow the exception as if it never occurred,0
its not sorting into ascneding ...,0
i tested it out,0
> ```py> def out_of_20(args):> lst = list(args)> lst = sorted(lst reverse=True)> ``` @Torment (Matured Pokermon) Would achieve the same thing@Jac_k you can just do `sorted(args reverse=True)`,1
> With what code@Jac_k the same one,0
no that's `.sort`,0
what does reverse do,0
yes it can take any iterable but it always returns a `list`,0
yeah i did,0
,0
i called the function and gave it some values an dprinted too,0
uhh i deleted it,0
@Jac_k ```pythondef out_of_20(args): lst = list(args) lst = sorted(args reverse=True) print(lst[0]) return```this is the code i used with some values,0
almost that one,0
it outputted the first value given in the parameter which was the highest value but ill check again,0
@Torment (Matured Pokermon) do you want the highest or the lowest,0
ascending order would be default,0
so no `reverse=True`,0
> @Torment (Matured Pokermon) do you want the highest or the lowest@gm i want it to print in ascending,0
remove `reverse=True`,0
k its printing in descending,0
done,0
removed that,0
thanks a lot guys you helped a lot i feel like i wouldnt know half of what i know about coding if i wasnt in this server,1

@Tim's business partner move cv.puttext to tryexcept block or in except assign something to `label`,0

wrong channel,0
also when it returns the object it says `at 0x7f9f1ace39d0` What does that mean???,0
hmm,0
oh oh ok what about how would I get the name of the instance??,0
what does `__repr__` do?and what I was trying to do was get the name of the instance like this```pyclass A(): def __init__(self): pass  def myinstance(self): return selfb = A()print(b.myinstance())```,1
but this returns the object @wookie nothing at all out of I just want to get the name of the instance out of curiosity,1
oh leme check that out,0
@wookie :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```This is a thing```,0

oh I get what `repr` does. Where would we use `__repr__`???,0
in what situations I meant,0
@Doctor Isn't `set` deprecated for random.choice?,0
hmm,0
ah right,0
@fix error That's not my code i just fixed that guy's indent,0
subscriptable and sized (has `len`),0
oh,0
sorry then,0
nope it can't interact with hardware directly,0
I mean you could make your own Python compiler that adds that as an extension...,0
@fix error And yes set cannot be used in random.choice since it doesn't support indexing,0
@king. Dude sent you fixed code 🙂,0
Like 10m ago,0
Because you got another error 🙂,0
You cannot use set objects in random.choice,0
@king. ```py@client.eventasync def on_message(message): if message.content == coinflip': variable = ['tail head ] await client.send_message(message.channel (random.choice(variable)))```,0

So this is what I have```pydef MyInstance():  def __init__(self): pass def instance_is(self): return selfb = MyInstance()b.instance_is()```this returns the memmory adress but how can I make it so that it would return `b`?,1

oh,0
@Inheritance ♦ If you want to return the _variable name_ where the object is stored that's not easy. And if you do ```pya = Foo()b = a```should it print `a` or `b`?,1
@fix error nothing cause it doesn't have print,0

`Foo()`?,0
ohh,0
I know what it would print I was asking what it should theoretically do if it printed the variable name,0
@clavlav12 A _class_ is created only once. You can do something when the class is created using a metaclass... What do you actually want to do?,1
https://discord.com/channels/267624335836053506/267659945086812160/771665579501289482why is the class Type `__main__`?,0
@wookie I guess you could iterate through the globals and see which name has the object,0
@clavlav12 You can do `Tile.classes[Tile.id] = Tile` afterwards,0
Just after the class definition,0
```pyclass Tile: id = 0 classes = {}Tile.classes[Tile.id] = Tile```,0
@clavlav12 Well when the body of the class is executed the class doesn't exist yet.,0
ohh so u can;t get the variable name?,0
I don't think so you can create one with a metaclass but I think it's overkill,0
hmm,0
that was what i was originally trying to do,0
I mean there _is_ a method that's called when the class is created. It's just that it's defined in its metaclass.,1
get the variable name of the instance,0
@Paelen ye i also just releazied after u said,0
Question... is there a way to have like smart if statements?For instance```pyif x == 1 or y == 2: # Then have something here which acts on the True part of the statment. Instead of having to do if x == 1: y += 3 else: x += 14```🤔,1
@fix error what would be the logic behind getting the variable name using a metaclass??,0
@Inheritance ♦ the metaclasses were directed at clavlav12,0
what,0
Not sure how metaclasses can help with your issue,0
ohh @fix error so u werent talking to me https://discord.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/771667584105054228,0

This sucks,0
i can't get the varaible name of an instance,0
`__repr__` is expected to return a string. Instead it returns an object,0

^,0
"Is there another way to loop through k,v pairs of a dict?",0
I'm 99% sure you can't index a dict,0
Why use dicts when you have classes,0
^,0
Cause i'm more use to classes... and in certain cases where I can use a dictionary i find it easier to make a custom object instead of using a dict to store the information,1

@Rami try with smaller numbers,0
@Rami Because it will take a lot of time,0
@Rami Since a  it's recursive b  you're computing set of factorials first,0
Rami: Memoization. You're computing the same thing tons and tons of time,0
Why are all the librabries that i use broken??,0
If you want to find N of combinations look up Pascal's triangle it does not require factorial,0
Save intermediate results so the only new work you have to do is for uncomputed results,0
@Deleted User whats the problem,0
Like can someone check if pyautogui works??,0
@Rami Sure what do you have to store and output tho?,0
it works,0
Also python is bad at recursion use loops,0
Also what Neko said. The naive Fibonnaci sequence we're usually taught is really bad,0
Most libraries for me are browken when i import them they all have internal errors@Amuri,0
@eivl man,0
First of all he does not need a recursive function at all,0
do you get import errors @Deleted User,0
Btw @eivl my phn had die really soory about that but now i finally understood the concept,0
Factorial can be calculated as folding a range with product,0
But recursion is better than not recursion :lemon_hyperpleased:,0
But the guy doesn't need the factorial as it seems cause he wants a number if combinations,0
Which can be found with other algorithms,0
Why are all the librabries that i use broken??,0
Like cansomeone check if pyautogui works??,0
Yeah you can,0
@eivl why would be school enforceing unidiomatic python?,0
You can even use python 3.6 with 3.6 together,0
@Qwerty uhhhh noo,0
lol oh man... Neko you have no idea,0
Do i need to upgrade??,0
If so then how??,0
Virtual environment or just install multiple python kernels,0
@Deleted User no if you are on 3.8.6 your safe,0
Some teachers actually force students to do things badly because the pain will make them avoid the bad way for the rest of their life,1

Basic numpy,0
The rest can be learnt with time,0
Eivl speaking about the factorial guy if the task requires him to compute factorial of 10e4 is it reasonable to use recursion with caching? It will probably fill the call stack pretty quickly on the first attempt.,1
There's not much in numpy tbh if you know the maths,0
Yeah hence a couple of days for basic numpy skills and I'll search up what I don't know cause <3 google,1

@pantsforbirds Your best option is probably to call a LaTeX executable from python.,0
LaTeX if very complex AFAIK so implementing it in Python would be a pain,0
@pantsforbirds Have you seen https://jeltef.github.io/PyLaTeX/current/ ?,0
that would just be a wrapper around subprocess,0
just write your own wrapper,0
@pantsforbirds If you just want to template a latex file you can look at Cog or other code/file generator,0
Can i somehow make something like this?```pyclass a: def __init__(self mycustomwrapper): self.wrapper = mycustomwrapper @self.wrapper #self wont be defined def func(): pass```,1
@Deleted User If you want to do something with each instance on its creation you can do that in `__init__`,0
`f84718281acd11eb982b0242ac120013`what is this keyerror?,0
I shud put the function iside the init then?,0
@Deleted User What exactly do you want to do?,0
`a` will take input as wrapper and then i want to wrap my functions in that class with that wrapper,0
@Deleted User we need some context,0
@Archiezzz there's no `switch/case` in Python 🙂,0
just fake it with dicts,0

@Deleted User make it a tuple?,0
"`session[str(session_id)]=(timeanddate,host,vc.name)`",0
or a named tuple or dataclass,0
will it work?,0
yeah but then accessing the items will be `session[str(session_id)][1]` for the host and etc,0

why are you using os.system in the first place,0
and why are you using python2 for the http server,0
@lightStack there is no upper or lower case for numbers.,0

@Skywalker thats the part that starts the websocket server?,0

I am not sure they understand the point...,0
wait is pytesseract also able to recognize images?,0
No,0
what they're saying is what problem are you really trying to solve here @Sm0kenBluntz,0
or i need to use another module,0
for image,0
,0
@Sm0kenBluntz You can catch the `KeyboardInterrupt` exception,0
iirc pytesseract is for OCR,0
@Darby missing closing parentheses on your input line,0
so idk if it sopport image recognize i need to to look for the image from a image file then it reads it and if in the screen shot has that little image in it it will click on it,1
but that's what i need,0
What is happening here.,0
I am trying to read screen shots from adb,0
which i know how to do but i need some sort of image recognition module,0
@Sm0kenBluntz they are trying to help when you asked for help in a public channel.,0
where everyone can see it.,0
alright chill out you guys,0
oh so pytesseract can do both OCR and Image that's nice,0
I am so bamboozled mentally...,0
Normally you don't brag about blocking a person too...,0
chill out you got an answer,0
If you want to catch the KeyboardInterrupt you’re free to do so. Just keep in mind that it’s generally bad practice and that there are much better solutions in 99.99% of cases.,1
@Skywalker try swapping `127.0.0.1:` for `localhost:` maybe a local DNS issue,0
Oh god. This is escalating to a point where I don't like it.,0
Both of you. Drop it.,0
@Sm0kenBluntz If you just want to look at the state of your program at some moment you can use breakpoints. ```pywhile True: if foo > bar: breakpoint() # this will open pdb (the python debugger)```,1

no i meant as in middle not the end,0

@MrxDev that really depends on the problem you're trying to solve,0
Those are multiple dictionaries,0

@prav which line gives you the error?,0
@prav you can't say `hunger = hunger5` when `hunger` hasn't been first defined anywhere.,0
`global hunger` doesn't do that,0
it doesn't do that in the top namespace anyway. you have to say `hunger=0` for it to have any meaning and then to reference it from the function you say `global hunger` in the function before using it.also it's bad practice to use globals generally.,1
It's just not a good idea for anything other than extremely trivial programs,0
and even there you can usually avoid it by just passing values to functions,0
note to self: when/if I ever get around to writing that beginner\'s guide to Python I\'m going to make don\'t use `global` a thing with alternatives,1
@Jayy making a new list is what I would do,0
@MattTheDuck I plan to have sidebyside examples of how to do things without using `global`,0

for the ot channels tho are the names randomly generated via concatenation or just selected from a list as they are,1

Mods+ can do `!otn a newname` to add a new name to the list. We currently have 700+ names I think,1
o,0
> I think one of the coding practices that I disliked the most in the past is the need to include the type of the variable in the name for example bool_foundwhatiwaslookingfor@Mike_P yep that is really dumb,1
@Mike_P I think that's a very good start. Back when I got into coding I made all these mistakes. It's a part of learning and once you get down the basics of things and are able to code things you want you should start getting into making the code more solid and collaborative. One big part of this for me was starting to work collaboratively. All these docstrings and best practices will be much more needed then. You'll check out other people's code and get feedback from other ones with different skillsets and experience. Things won't be perfect from the beginning but that just a part of the learning process. Just go with it and enjoy the process; that's the best we can do 😄,1
@Aboo Minister it's probably one of the numeric types that doesn't have a transformer node associated with it yet. You have to create a node to extract the actual numeric value that's not done automatically,1
@Aboo Minister when you create a Lark parser for things like ints as one of the possible tokens the parser does not automatically turn those nodes into ints. It just makes sure whatever can be tokenized is valid as an int,1
so you need to create a node that works with the numeric types extracts the value from the incoming node verifies that value is an int and returns that value,1
Linting and similar things aren't really that important in the beginning. As long as you learn it later on I think people should feel free to express themselves creatively before being restricted. The part about coding in the beginning in particular is how you don't have such restrictions. They'll be added on later on so they don't make the beginning dry and boring. At the end of the day programming is about problem solving and finding solutions!,1
same as with any other node,0

@Slow for functions with deterministic output it caches the output,0
The LRU just stands for least recently used. It's just a normal cache I guess this just tells Python to use it,1
it also requires that the arguments to the function be hashable,0

"Ah. It has a few practical uses. There is something in python called duck typing which means you try to do something and if it fails you simply catch that error and handle it. That\'s often preferred over checking the type of objects and similar. Like this: ```pyx = 0try: print(5/x) # This will throw a ZeroDivisionError since you can\'t divide by zeroexcept ZeroDivisionError: print(""Hey you can\'t divide by zero!"")```This will prevent you from having to check all the cases where it could go wrong in beforehand and do this instead",1

i've heard that u can use openvc or something like that,0
yes the retain insertion order,0
however they do not support indexing,0
can someone tell me How pls,0

why do people use numpy arrays instead of just lists?,0
@Pilot can you explain how thatt code works?,0
@Pedro. Because they're easier to use,0
In some cases,0
Plus they can store data as c types so they can be more memory efficient,0

yes appending many times,0

You are not allowed to use that command here. Please use the #botcommands channel instead.,0
@Pilot Converting d.keys() to list would take some time so it's not very good way to do it. Plus order isn't guaranteed i believe,1
finding the `n`th element of a dictionary is O(n) always,0
I know that dict keep it's elements in insertion order since some python version but i wouldn't rely on that,0

is there any like videos or something to show how to do it?,0
wdym sub getters? @Codec,0
bedwars could another object you know?,0

not really,0
else pass is not necessary lol,0
print the result,0
you could also uh return a value when you find something,0
hello 😄 im new here!,0
you do nothing with the result,0
del key,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan His function is also not correct,0
He should return True in the end of function,0
@Supermania it won't work properly,0
the bool will be the result of testing the last item,0
you should exit early when you find a negative value,0
that doesn't look valid,0
that's what it's used for now,0
if you give me a few minutes I'll get to my computer and show you,0
or maybe someone else should jump in,0
```pydef all_elements_positive(list_2d: list): return all(i >= 0 for row in list_2d for i in row)```,0

it should be list of lists,0

@Supermania If you mean list_2d parameter,0

the former definitely,0
How would I add a space between every letter and number?,0
Can `all` shortcircuit? (You'd thnik so but you can never trust developers),0
@TheKing Wdym shortcircuit lol,0
Stop when you know the answer,0
I believe it does return False immediately when it encounters False or falsey element,0
It should since it's obvious optimization,0

I am a beginner to python and how long can i learn it?,0
What if I work 3 hours a day?,0
You could spend a few years learning Python and that's fine... but you should focus more on important concepts like algorithms data structures and so on,1
thank u,0
Those skills transfer across languages and will let you write better software than just using the most advanced features of a language will,1
> bruh i see people straight going into frameworks and libraries without learning the data structures  algorithms.@Slow is that ok or not?,1
What is the best programming language in your opinion? Most preferred,0
Haskell or Idris without a doubt,0
Python has issues but it's usually pretty nice :pydis_strong:,0
@MarkyMooMoo if Python is your first language most any part of it can be a stumbling block because this is your first exposure to many common computing metaphors,1
@MarkyMooMoo do you need `for` and `while` explained better?,0

Hey so what would I have to write if I would want a program that adds a space between every letter and number? Would the best approach be to use Regexes or something else?,1
` .join(list(string))` probably,0
actually you don't even need the list part,0
My only problem with that is that it adds a space between everything would there be a way to tell it to only do it when there's a letter and number all sticked together?,1
there probably isn't a pretty one liner for that,0
just loop over the string and check,0
That's where Regexes come into place right?,0
regex should work yea,0
Welp just gotta figure out how it works (or how to use it)...,0

@Fairchild_Martindale what line?,0
Python doesn't have ++,0
Use `x += 1` instead,0

you can move that line to after the ifelse since it's run no matter what.,0

@Fairchild_Martindale also line 21 needs to be further to the left.,0
@Fairchild_Martindale with line number.,0
is it line 41? You have count++ there,0

@D. 🔮 profiling code.,0
@D. 🔮 there's a standard library module `cProfile` that lets you run code and determine where it spends most of its time. this is a clue as to what parts of the program need the most optimization,1
basically you want to speed up the parts of the program that most need it.,0
more or less but you concentrate your efforts on the things that are clearly slowest by the stats,0
yeah it's one of several tools but it's the one included with Python so it's a good place to start,0
the key thing is that it keeps you from wasting time optimzing things that don't need it,0
trick,0
this is pythongeneral,0

ok,0
so an instance is basically the variable and the data for that variable?,0

That's probably the easiest way in Python. Any other way I can think of would take more work,0
That should be it,0
If you want to cast and concat at the same time you can probably use `reduce`,0
That may create a lot of intermediate lists though :O,0
What's wrong with reduce?,0
It's early morning most people are at sleep or at work,0
It's just `fold`. I think you are right about it bot being efficient though hence my statement about intermediate lists :/,1

yeah I don't see why Python could be used for say controlling an airship. It might not be advanced enough.,0
How would python not be advanced enough? The main problem would probably be the performance in speed needed,0
or that,0
i can just imagine no turn right! now! and the airship needing 30 seconds to receive the command to move to the right,1
having already destroyed 2 asteroids,0
That would be terrible programming and planning.,0
I don\'t mean that as Python is unoptimized it\'s just slow and for critical missions that could make a world of a difference,1
would it take 30 seconds?,0
I honestly don't think it would be a problem in most cases. Languages like C++ are generally used for things like robotics though so I would expect them to use something like that,1
or a tiem like that,0
When/where is Lua used? Are they used into stuff like programs games robotics etc.?,0

Anyone know how to pack asyncpg with pyinstaller? The `asyncpg.pgproto.pgproto` import fails.,0

js is just binded to response,0

@cos you made a new list you didn't put a reference of `current` into `past`,0
Do you have any useful things to create in the console?,0
@✪ SavagePastaMan when you say new list what do you mean exactly?,0
@Seagull so what is the best way to just pass a copy of the current list at any given point,0
i don't want it to be mutable,0
i mean you put `[0 0]` in not `past`,0
dont worry about it,0
@joku the point here is i need to append it,0
not overwrite the entire past list,0
thats probably better but im still wondering why my example didnt work,0
@Kingboi py ver.sion,0
and why saying old_list += [newlist] then updating the new list would affect the copy in the old_list,0
`py 3.8` for example,0
i have to be not understanding how the new list is being passed,0
it has to be a pointer,0
Hey @joku!,0
@Kingboi `py` not `python`,0
How,0
"```python>>> past = [[0,0]]>>> past.append(current)>>> past[[0 0] [1 0]]>>> current[1] += 1>>> past[[0 0] [1 1]]```same behavior @joku",0

@marc @Julian Its better to use `reversed(alist)` because `[::1]` creates an unnecessary copy of the list. Consider:```python>>> alist = list(range(108))>>> def test1():... for _ in alist[::1]:... pass...>>> def test2():... for _ in reversed(alist):... pass...>>> from timeit import timeit>>> timeit(test1 number=1)1.3084171999999938>>> timeit(test2 number=1)0.7769257000000067```,1
